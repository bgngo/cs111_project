chair, while Monica and Phoebe are out on the balcony.]

RACHEL: Huh, I`ve just never. . . had a relationship with that kind
of passion, you know, where, where you have to have somebody
right there in the middle of a theme park.

ROSS: Well it was the only thing to do there, that didn`t have a line.

RACHEL: Alright well, see, I mean, Barry wouldn`t even kiss me on a
minature golf course.

ROSS: Come on.

RACHEL: No..he said we were holding up the people behind us. ( Rachel
sighs )

ROSS: And you didn`t marry him be-cause?

RACHEL: I mean d`you think. there are people that go through life never
having that kind of.

ROSS: Probably.

RACHEL: Really?

ROSS: But, but, you know I`ll tell you something, passion is way over
rated.

RACHEL: Yeah, right!

ROSS: It is, er eventually it kinds of burns out, but hopefully what
you are left with is trust and security and er, well in the case
of my ex-wife. . . . .lesbianism! So you know for all those
people who miss out on that er, passion thing, there`s all that
other good stuff.

RACHEL: ( Sighs ) Ok.

ROSS: But er, I don`t think that`s gonna be you. . . .

RACHEL: You don`t ?

ROSS: Umm, see I see, er, big. . . . . . passion in your future.

RACHEL: Really?

ROSS: Umm

RACHEL: Ya do?

[SCENE: Cuts back to chandler at the bank.]

JILL: Would you like some gum?

CHANDLER: Oh is it sugarless?

JILL: Oh sorry it`s not.

CHANDLER: Oh,then no thanks. ( Voice over. ) What the hell was that,
mental note if Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it, if
she offers you mangled animal carcass you take it!

[SCENE: Time lapse. Cuts back to Monica and Rachels apartment, Phoebe
is singing.]

PHOEBE: # New york city has no power and the milk is getting sour, but

MONICA: Joey, what`s goin` on?

JOEY: Ok, listen, you gotta promise you`ll never ever tell Ross that I

MONICA: About what?

JOEY: He`s planning your birthday party.

MONICA: Oh my God, I love him.

JOEY: And you better act surprised!

PHOEBE: ( Over hearing. ) About what?

MONICA: My surprise party!

PHOEBE: What surprise party?

MONICA: Ohh stop it! Joey already told me.

PHOEBE: Well he didn`t tell me!

JOEY: Hey, don`t look at me, this is Ross`s thing.

PHOEBE: This is so typical, I`m always the last one to know everything!

MONICA: Oh, you are not, we tell you stuff.

PHOEBE: Ya hur! I was the last one to know. When Chandler got bit by
the peacock at the zoo, I was the last to know, when you had a
crush on Joey when he was moving in!

[Monica stares at Phoebe and waves frantically behind Joey.]

JOEY: What??

PHOEBE: Ohh Ohh, looks like I was the second to last.

[Joey starts to laugh, Monica takes off her coat.]

[SCENE: Cuts to Ross and Rachel on the balcony.]

ROSS: (sighs)

RACHEL: Erm, so nice.

ROSS: Um,hey,I have a question, well er, actually it`s not so much a
question as more of a general wondering....ment.

RACHEL: Ok.

ROSS: Ok, huh, here goes.Um, well for a while now, I`ve been wanning
to um....

RACHEL: Ohhhhh.

ROSS: Yes, yes, that`s, that`s right.

ROSS: What?

[The cat jumps from the ledge on to Ross`s shoulder]

ROSS: Ohhhhhaahhhhhhh!!!!!!!

[SCENE: Cuts back to inside the apartment, where Phoebe is leading
Joey and Monica in a rendition of "Top of the World"]

JOEY, PHOEBE & MONICA: # Top of the world, lookin`, down on creation,
and the only explanation I can find, is the love I`ve found, ever
since you`ve been around ( While they are singing, fur is flying
out on the balcony, Ross is trying to lose the cat, by jumping up
the down in a frantic panic!!!!)

[SCENE: Time lapse. Everyone is stood round the kitchen table and Ross
is receiving medical attention from Monica. Chandler is still at the
bank.

MONICA: Right, this is just Bactine, it won`t hurt.

[Joey, who is leaning over Ross with a candle, accidently lets a drip
of wax fall on to Ross`s neck.]

ROSS: Ou! Ou!

JOEY: Ooo, sorry that was wax.

PHOEBE: Ooh, this poor little tuti is scared to death! We should find
his owner.

ROSS: Why don`t we just put the poor little TUTI out in the hall?

RACHEL: During a blackout? She`ll get trampled!

ROSS: Yeahh?

[SCENE: Back at the bank.]

CHANDLER: You know on second thoughts gum would be perfection! ( Takes
a stick of gum from Jill. Chandler hardly believing what he
just said goes into voice over mode. ) Gum would be perfection,
GUM would be perfection, coulda said gum would be nice,
could of said I`ll have a stick, but no no no no for me, GUM
is PERFECTION!''.. I loathe my-self. ( At this point Chandler
goes over to a counter and covers his head in shame. )

[SCENE: Cuts back to Rachel and Phoebe searching out in the halls of
their building, knocking on various doors. )

RACHEL: ( About to knock on a door ) Oh, no the Melons, they hate all
living things!

PHOEBE: Oh.

[They move on to the next door, and knock. A strange man answers. )

RACHEL: Hi, we just found this cat, and we er, looking for the owner.

MAN: Umm yeah, It`s er, It`s mine.

PHOEBE: Well, he seems to hate you, are you sure?

MAN: Yeah, It`s my cat, give me my cat.

PHOEBE: Well, er, wait a minute, what`s his name?

MAN: Er, Ba Buttons.

RACHEL: Bob buttons?

MAN: Ah huh, Bob Buttons, here Bob Buttons.

PHOEBE: ( The cat jumps out of Phoebe`s arms, and disappears down the
hall. ) Ooo, ..ahh, you are a very BAD man!

RACHEL: Cah.

[Rachel and Phoebe walk off to try and catch the cat.]

MAN: ( Leaning out of his door. ) You owe me a cat! ( He shuts his door. )

[SCENE: Cuts to Rachel on her own in the dark hallway, with only one
candle, searching for the cat.]

RACHEL: Here kitty kitty kitty, here kitty kitty, where`d ya go little
kitty kitty kitty. ( Rachel tries calling the cat by making a
kind of kissing sound. ) Kitty, kitty, kitty, come `ere kitty
kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty kitty.. kitty ( Rachel comes
across a pair of legs in the dark, she moves slowly upwards. )
kitty..hi? ( Rachel is now face to face with a man in the
corridor. )

MAN 2: Bwensa sear.

RACHEL: Oh wow! ( She blows out her candle, with her sigh. )

[SCENE: Cuts back to the apartment, where Ross, Monica and Joey are
playing monopoly.]

ROSS: Come on, lucky sixes!

[Rachel enters the apartment with the man she met in the hallway by
her side.]

RACHEL: Everybody, this is Paolo. ( Ross is stunned. ) Paolo I want you
to meet my friends, this is Monica ( They walk over to where
they are playing. )

MONICA: ( Shaking Paolo by his hand. ) Hi.

RACHEL: And Joey. ( They shake hands. )

MONICA: Hi. ( Trying to get Paolo`s attention. )

JOEY: ( Quietly ) Alright?

RACHEL: And, and Ross.

MONICA: Hi. ( Still trying to get Paolo`s attention. )

PAOLO: ( He speaks Italian. ) Regat se son a pina viv vanta to be pino

RACHEL: Hur, hur hur, he doesn`t speak much English. ( Rachel is
rubbing her hands up and down his arm. )

[Paolo looks down at the table.]

PAOLO: Mon Op Poleeeee!!

RACHEL: Ohhhh, look at that.
ROSS: ( Ross tuts. ) So, er, where did er, Paolo come from ..

RACHEL: Oh, ..Italy, I think? Hur hur hur.

RACHEL: Well, the that cat, the ca cat, turned out to be Paolo`s cat,
Int that funny. I think it`s his cat.

ROSS: Oh hur, that that, is funny and Rachel keeps touching him.

[Rachel rubs Paolo arms some more. Phoebe enters the apartment. ]

PHOEBE: Alright, I looked all over the building and I couldn`t find
the kitty anywhere.

RACHEL: Oh I found him. It was Paolo`s cat.

PHOEBE: Ahh, well, there ya go, last to know again, and I`m guessing
since no body told me this is Paolo.

RACHEL: Oh Paolo, this is Phoebe.

PAOLO: Oh.

PHOEBE: Hi.

PAOLO: Phoebe an ca tu belissimo ser setta tuti caus a wella mitros

[SCENE: Cuts back to the bank. Chandler is try to think of something to
do to impress Jill.]

CHANDLER: ( Voice over. ) What next?.I know, blow a bubble, a bubbles

a bubble. )here we go. ( But he ends up spitting the gum on
to the counter. ) Nice goin` IMP. Ok, ok It`s, It`s ok, all I
need to do is reach over and put it back in my mouth,
( Chandler reaches over the counter, to retrieve the gum, but
in order not to attract Jill`s attention to what he is doing,
he doesn`t look at what his hand is doing. He picks up some
gum off the counter, and puts it discreetly in to his mouth. )
Good save! We`re back on track and I`m.... [ He chews the gum
a bit.] chewing some elses gum!!!!!! This is not my gum! OH MY
GOD! OH MY GOD! .....and now your choking! Caac. ( Chandler
starts to choke. ) Caac.

JILL: Are you alright?

[Chandler makes a OK gesture with his hands and smiles, while choking.]

JILL: Oh my God, your choking. ( Jill gets up quickly and goes over to
Chandler. She then performs the Hiemlich manoeuvre and the gum
shoots out of his mouth. )

CHANDLER: Err...Hurr.

JILL: Better?

CHANDLER: Eh hur, yes, ( Chandler clears his throat .) Thank you, that
was, that was....

JILL: Perfection?

CHANDLER: Tayeah!

[SCENE: Cuts back to the apartment. Paolo is talking to Rachel in
Italian, while looking out of the window and pointing to the night
sky. )

PAOLO: Guarda da lunar, guarda da stelle, gua tu tal cause a belle.

[Cuts back to Ross with Joey in the kitchen watching Paolo and Rachel
with disgust. )

ROSS: Blur blur blur blur blurrrrr, blur blur blur blur, blur blur

[Paolo and Rachel finish talking by the window and Rachel makes her
way over to the kitchen area.]

RACHEL: Hur hur hur hur. Er Ohhhhh.

RACHEL: I have absolutely no idea.

ROSS: That`s, that`s classic!

RACHEL: Oh my God, you guys, whata my doin` whata my doin` this is so

MONICA: If you want, I`ll do it.

PHOEBE: Oh I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip, ( Monica and
Rachel both look at Phoebe. )

RACHEL: Cah.

PHOEBE: But I won`t.

RACHEL: God, the first time he smiled, at me, those three seconds were
more exciting than three weeks in Burmuda with Barry.

PHOEBE: Ya know, did you rent mopeds..because I`ve heard.. ( Monica
and Rachel give Phoebe a very strange look. ) Oh It`s not
about that right now, ok.

RACHEL: Oh, God, you know, I know It`s totally superfical, and we have
nothing in common, and we don`t even speak the same language,
but Gohohohodddddd.

[Ross upset after listening to what Rachel had to say, decides to go

[SCENE: Back to the bank, Chandler and Jill are sitting on the floor,
facing each other, playing a game with the banks, pens on a chain.]

JILL: Chandler, we`ve been here for an hour doing this, now watch,
It`s easy.

CHANDLER: Ok.

JILL: Ready?

CHANDLER: Er, hum!

JILL: ( She spins the pen round her head. ) Ok, now try it.

[Chandler spins the pen patheticly and it hits him in the face.]

JILL: No, you gotta whip it.

[Chandler whips the pen round on it`s chain, and flies almost out of
control. Chandler and Jill both duck and laugh.]

[SCENE: Back at the apartment, we get a close up of a candle, which is
almost burnt out. All are gathered round the table in the lounge.]

PHOEBE: Oh look, look, look, the last candle is about to burn out.

[Chandler watches Jill leave and goes to the glass doors and presses
his face and hands up against the glass in awe. He runs his fingers
down the glass.]

CHANDLER: ( Turning round to the security camera up in the corner of
the room, by the ceiling. ) Hi, erm, I`m account number
