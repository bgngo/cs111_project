SCENE 1: CENTRAL PERK. (ALL PRESENT EXCEPT RACHEL AND ROSS)

MONICA: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!

JOEY: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be
something wrong with him!

CHANDLER: So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?

PHOEBE: Wait, does he eat chalk?

(THE OTHERS STARE, BEMUSED)

PHOEBE: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went
through with Carl- oh!

MONICA: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just
two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.

CHANDLER: Sounds like a date to me.

(CUT TO SAME SET)

CHANDLER: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the
middle of the cafeteria, and I realise I am totally naked.

ALL: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.

CHANDLER: Then I look down, and I realise there's a phone... there.

JOEY: Instead of...?

CHANDLER: That's right.

JOEY: Never had that dream.

PHOEBE: No.

CHANDLER: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. And it turns
out it's my mother, which is very weird, because- she never
calls me!

(CUT TO SAME SET. ROSS HAS NOW ENTERED)

ROSS: (MORTIFIED) Hi.

JOEY: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.

MONICA: Are you okay, sweetie?

ROSS: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my
small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it
around my neck...

CHANDLER: Cookie?

MONICA: (EXPLAINING TO THE OTHERS) Carol moved her stuff out today.
(TO ROSS) Let me get you some coffee.

PHOEBE: Ooh! Oh! (STARTS TO PLUCK AT THE AIR JUST IN FRONT OF ROSS)

ROSS: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my
aura alone, okay? I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I
hope she'll be very happy.

MONICA: No you don't.

ROSS: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!

JOEY: And you never knew she was a lesbian...

ROSS: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She
didn't know, how should I know?

CHANDLER: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (THE OTHERS STARE
AT HIM) Did I say that out loud?

JOEY: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right
now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the
answer is?

(ROSS GESTURES HIS CONSENT)

JOEY: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!

ROSS: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just
wanna be married again!

(ENTER RACHEL IN A WET WEDDING DRESS. SHE STARTS TO SEARCH AROUND
THE ROOM)

CHANDLER: And I just want a million dollars! (EXTENDS HIS HAND
HOPEFULLY)

MONICA: Rachel?!

RACHEL: Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you
weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you
might be here and you are, you are!

WAITRESS: Can I get you some coffee?

MONICA: (POINTING AT RACHEL) De-caff. (TO THE GANG) Okay, everybody,
this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (TO RACHEL)
This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey,
and- you remember my brother Ross?

RACHEL: Hi, sure!

ROSS: Hi.

(THEY GO TO HUG BUT ROSS' UMBRELLA OPENS. HE SITS, DEFEATED AGAIN)

(A MOMENT OF SILENCE AS RACHEL SITS; THE OTHERS EXPECT HER TO EXPLAIN)

MONICA: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet
bridesmaids?

RACHEL: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the
wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the
presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really
gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-
(TO WAITRESS, WHO HAS BROUGHT HER COFFEE)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I
realised that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than
by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when
it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know,
I mean, he always looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had
to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing
this, and who am I doing this for?'. (TO MONICA) So anyway
I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I
have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew
who lived here in the city.

MONICA: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

RACHEL: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...

SCENE 2: MONICA'S APARTMENT (ALL PRESENT AND WATCHING A SPANISH
SOAP ON TV)

MONICA: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ,
and she's really not happy about it.

RACHEL: (ON PHONE) Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry.
I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!

CHANDLER: (RE TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.

JOEY: I say push her down the stairs.

PHOEBE+ROSS+CHANDLER+JOEY: Push her down the stairs! Push her down
the stairs! Push her down the stairs! (SHE IS PUSHED DOWN THE
STAIRS. THEY CHEER)

RACHEL: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has
always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a
shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said,
'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a
purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you
to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor,
Daddy!

ROSS: You can see where he'd have trouble.

RACHEL: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here
with Monica.

MONICA: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with
Monica...

RACHEL: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need
your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!

(CUT TO SAME SET. RACHEL IS BREATHING INTO A PAPER BAG)

MONICA: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of
nice calm things...

PHOEBE: (SINGS) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,
(RACHEL AND MONICA TURN TO LOOK AT HER)..bluebells and
sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...

RACHEL: I'm all better now.

PHOEBE: (GRINS AND WALKS TO KITCHEN. TO CHANDLER AND JOEY) I helped!

MONICA: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know?
Independence. Taking control of your life.

JOEY: (SITTING BESIDE HER) And hey, you need anything, you can
always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall.
And he's away a lot.

MONICA: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!

JOEY: What, like there's a rule or something?

(THE DOOR BUZZER SOUNDS. CHANDLER GETS IT)

CHANDLER: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.

PAUL: (OVER INTERCOM) It's, uh, it's Paul.

MONICA: Buzz him in!

JOEY: Who's Paul?

ROSS: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?

MONICA: Maybe.

JOEY: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?

ROSS: He finally asked you out?

MONICA: Yes!

CHANDLER: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.

MONICA: Rach, wait, I can cancel...

RACHEL: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!

MONICA: (TO ROSS) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?

ROSS: (CHOKED VOICE) That'd be good...

MONICA: (HORRIFIED) Really?

ROSS: (NORMAL VOICE) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!

(A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. MONICA GETS IT; IT'S PAUL)

MONICA: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (THEY ARE ALL LINED UP NEXT
TO THE DOOR)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.

ALL: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!

CHANDLER: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?

MONICA: (SHOWS PAUL IN) Two seconds.

PHOEBE: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.

ROSS: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?

RACHEL: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my
honeymoon, so nothing!

ROSS: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no,
although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (THINKS)
-big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone
tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put
together my new furniture.

CHANDLER: (DEADPAN) Yes, and we're very excited about it.

RACHEL: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out
here tonight..

ROSS: Okay, sure.

JOEY: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?

PHOEBE: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.

(AD BREAK)

SCENE 3: ROSS' APARTMENT (THE GUYS ARE ASSEMBLING FURNITURE)

ROSS: (SQUATTING AND READING INSTRUCTIONS) I'm supposed to attach
a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these
little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no worm guys
whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.

(CHANDLER AND JOEY HAVE APPARENTLY FINISHED A BOOKCASE, BUT THERE
IS A BIT LEFT OVER)

JOEY: What's this?

CHANDLER: I have no idea.

(JOEY CHECKS ROSS IS NOT LOOKING AND DUMPS IN IN A PLANT POT)

JOEY: Done with the bookcase!

CHANDLER: All finished!

ROSS: (CLUTCHING A BEER CAN AND SNIFFING) This was Carol's favourite
beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.

JOEY: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the
stereo, the good TV- what did you get?

ROSS: You guys.

CHANDLER: Oh, man.

JOEY: You got screwed.

(CUT TO MONICA AND PAUL EATING IN A RESTAURANT)

MONICA: Oh my God!

PAUL: I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have
caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five
times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?

MONICA: My brother's going through that right now, he's such a
mess. How did you get through it?

PAUL: Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable
of hers, say her-

MONICA: -leg?

PAUL: (LAUGHING) That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.

MONICA: You actually broke her watch?

(CUT TO RACHEL IN MONICA'S APARTMENT, TALKING ON THE PHONE AND PACING)

RACHEL: Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably
think that this is all about what I said the other day about
you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it
isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (STOPS TALKING; DIALS A
NUMBER ON THE PHONE) Hi, machine cut me off again...
anyway...

(CUT TO ROSS' APARTMENT)

ROSS: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one
woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman-
and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one
woman- for her...

JOEY: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying
there's only one flavour of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you
something, Ross. There's lots of flavours out there. There's
Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You
could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is
the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you
were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a
spoon!

ROSS: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.

CHANDLER: Stay out of my freezer!

(CUT TO THE RESTAURANT)

PAUL: Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...

MONICA: What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?

PAUL: No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.

MONICA: Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?

PAUL: Isn't there?

MONICA: Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?

PAUL: Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been
able to, uh, perform. (MONICA TAKES A SIP OF HER DRINK)
...Sexually.

MONICA: (SPITS OUT HER DRINK IN SHOCK) Oh God, oh God, I am
sorry... I am so sorry...

PAUL: It's okay...

MONICA: Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.
Um... how long?

PAUL: Two years.

MONICA: Wow! I'm glad you smashed her watch!

PAUL: So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?

MONICA: (PAUSE)...Yeah. Yeah, I do.

(CUT TO RACHEL WATCHING 'JOANIE LOVES CHACHI')

TV: 'I, Joanie, take you, Charles, to be my lawful husband.'
'Do you take...'

RACHEL: Oh...see... but Joanie loved Chachi! That's the difference!

(CUT TO ROSS')

ROSS: (SCORNFUL) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been
since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a
hero' mean anything to you? Y'know, here's the thing. Even if
I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who
am I gonna ask? (GAZES OUT OF THE WINDOW)

(CUT TO RACHEL STARING OUT OF HER WINDOW)

SCENE 4: MONICA + RACHEL'S APARTMENT. RACHEL IS MAKING COFFEE FOR
JOEY AND CHANDLER)

RACHEL: Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before
in my entire life.

CHANDLER: That is amazing.

JOEY: Congratulations. And while you're on a roll, if you feel
like you gotta make like a Western omelette or something...
(JOEY AND CHANDLER TASTE THE COFFEE, GRIMACE, AND POUR IT INTO
A PLANT POT) Although actually I'm really not that hungry...

(ENTER MONICA FROM HER ROOM)

ALL: Morning. Good morning.

(ENTER PAUL FROM MONICA'S ROOM)

PAUL: Morning.

JOEY: Morning, Paul.

RACHEL: Hello, Paul.

CHANDLER: Hi, Paul, is it?

(MONICA AND PAUL WALK TO THE DOOR AND TALK IN A LOW VOICE SO THE
OTHERS CAN'T HEAR. THE OTHERS SHUNT MONICA'S TABLE CLOSER TO TO THE
DOOR SO THEY CAN)

MONICA: I had a really great time last night.

PAUL: Thank you. Thank you so much.

MONICA: We'll talk later.

PAUL: Yeah. (THEY KISS) Thank you. (EXIT PAUL)

JOEY: That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real
date?

MONICA: Shut up, and put my table back.

ALL: Okayyy! (THEY DO)

CHANDLER: All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input
those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...

RACHEL: So, like, you guys all have jobs?

MONICA: Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.

JOEY: Yeah, I'm an actor.

RACHEL: Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?

JOEY: I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

MONICA: Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns'
production of Pinocchio.

CHANDLER: 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'

JOEY: I will not take this abuse. (WALKS TO DOOR AND OPENS IT TO
LEAVE)

CHANDLER: You're right, I'm sorry. (BURSTS INTO SONG AND DANCES
OUT OF THE DOOR) 'Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden
boy..'

(EXIT JOEY AND CHANDLER)

MONICA: So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

RACHEL: I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in
your mouth.

MONICA: I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and
Tony DeMarco?

RACHEL: Oh, yeah.

MONICA: Well, it's like that. With feelings.

RACHEL: Oh wow. Are you in trouble.

MONICA: Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not
think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and
go to work.

RACHEL: Oh, look, wish me luck!

MONICA: What for?

RACHEL: I'm gonna go get one of those job things.

(EXIT MONICA)

SCENE 5: IRIDIUM (JUST MONICA, WORKING)

(ENTER FRANNIE)

FRANNIE: Hey, Monica!

MONICA: Hey, welcome back! How was Florida?

FRANNIE: You had sex, didn't you?

MONICA: How do you do that?

FRANNIE: So? Who?

MONICA: You know Paul?

FRANNIE: Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.

MONICA: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?

FRANNIE: Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before
me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.

(CUT TO THE GANG MINUS RACHEL AT CENTRAL PERK)

JOEY: (PERCHED ON THE SIDE OF THE SOFA)Of course it was a line!

MONICA: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?

ROSS: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated
than 'to get you into bed'.

MONICA: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that
only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?

PHOEBE: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (SHE MASSAGES THEM)

MONICA: I just thought he was nice, y'know?

JOEY: (BURSTS OUT LAUGHING AGAIN) I can't believe you didn't
know it was a line!

(MONICA PUSHES HIM OFF THE SOFA. ENTER RACHEL WITH SHOPPING)

RACHEL: Guess what?

ROSS: You got a job?

RACHEL: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed
out of twelve interviews today.

CHANDLER: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.

RACHEL: You would be too if you found John and David boots on
sale, fifty percent off!

CHANDLER: Oh, how well you know me...

RACHEL: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my
parents, I've got great boots' boots!

MONICA: How'd you pay for them?

RACHEL: Uh, credit card.

MONICA: And who pays for that?

RACHEL: Um... my... father.

(CUT TO THE GANG AT MONICA + RACHEL'S, SITTING ROUND A TABLE.
ON THE TABLE ARE RACHEL'S CREDIT CARDS AND A PAIR OF SCISSORS)

MONICA: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.

RACHEL: I know that. That's why I was getting married.

PHOEBE: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the
first time.

RACHEL: Thank you.

PHOEBE: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this
city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself
and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and
I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this
albino guy who was, like, cleaning windows outside port
authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found
aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.

(A PAUSE)

ROSS: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...

MONICA: You ready?

RACHEL: I don't think so.

ROSS: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...

ALL: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (SHE CUTS THEM ALL UP.
THEY CHEER)

MONICA: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!

(CUT TO SAME SET. MONICA, RACHEL AND ROSS HAVE JUST FINISHED
WATCHING A FILM)

MONICA: Well, that's it.

RACHEL: (TO ROSS) You gonna crash on the couch?

ROSS: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.

MONICA: You be okay?

ROSS: Yeah.

RACHEL: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.
(MON SMILES) What?

MONICA: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found
it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody. (STOMPS ON PAUL'S
WATCH AND GOES TO HER ROOM)

ROSS: Mmm. (THEY BOTH REACH FOR THE LAST COOKIE) Oh, no-

RACHEL: Sorry-

ROSS: No no no, go-

RACHEL: No, you have it, really, I don't want it-

ROSS: Split it?

RACHEL: Okay.

ROSS: Okay. (THEY SPLIT IT) You know you probably didn't know this,
but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.

RACHEL: I knew.

ROSS: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

RACHEL: I did.

ROSS: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense
vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you
think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?

RACHEL: Yeah, maybe...

ROSS: Okay... okay, maybe I will...

RACHEL: Goodnight.

ROSS: Goodnight.

(EXIT RACHEL TO HER BEDROOM. ENTER MONICA IN DRESSING GOWN, AS
ROSS IS LEAVING)

MONICA: See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?

ROSS: I just grabbed a spoon. (EXIT ROSS)

(CLOSING CREDITS)

CREDITS SCENE: CENTRAL PERK

JOEY: I can't believe what I'm hearing here.

PHOEBE: (SINGS) I can't believe what I'm hearing here...

MONICA: What? I-I said you had a-

PHOEBE: (SINGS) What I said...

MONICA: (TO PHOEBE) Would you stop?

PHOEBE: Oh, was I doing it again?

RACHEL: (WALKS UP WITH A POT OF COFFEE) Would anybody like more
coffee?

CHANDLER: Did you make it, or are you just serving it?

RACHEL: I'm just serving it.

ALL: Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.

CHANDLER: Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minelli-

PRE-INTRO SCENE: CENTRAL PERK

(ALL PRESENT)

MONICA: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as
important as any part of it.

JOEY: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?

PHOEBE: Oh, yeah!

RACHEL: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.

MONICA: Absolutely.

CHANDLER: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an
opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian
you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.

ROSS: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's
that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.

CHANDLER: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter
how great the show was, you girls are always looking for
the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're
fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.

RACHEL: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian.
Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at
home, listening to that album alone.

JOEY: (PAUSE)....Are we still talking about sex?

SCENE 1: MUSEUM OF PREHISTORIC HISTORY (ROSS AND MARSHA ARE SETTING
UP AN EXHIBIT, WHICH INCLUDES SOME MANNEQUINS OF CAVE PEOPLE)

ROSS: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem
a little angry?

MARSHA: Well, she has issues.

ROSS: Does she.

MARSHA: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while
she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the
carpet!

ROSS: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like
'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?

MARSHA: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?

(CAROL HAS ENTERED BEHIND THEM, OUTSIDE THE EXHIBIT)

ROSS: (TRYING TO IGNORE HER) No. No.

MARSHA: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!

ROSS: Okay, okay, yes, it is. (WAVING) How about I'll, uh, catch up
with you in the Ice Age.

(EXIT MARSHA. ROSS WAVES AT CAROL TO COME INTO THE EXHIBIT)

ROSS:Hi.

CAROL: So.

ROSS: You look great. I, uh... I hate that.

CAROL: Sorry. You look good too.

ROSS: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new?
Still, uh...

CAROL: A lesbian?

ROSS: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?

CAROL: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-

ROSS: Why- why are you here, Carol?

CAROL: I'm pregnant.

ROSS: Pregnant?!

(CUT TO MONICA AND RACHEL'S APARTMENT, WHERE CHANDLER, JOEY, PHOEBE
AND MONICA ARE WATCHING 'THREE'S COMPANY')

CHANDLER: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where
there's some kind of misunderstanding.

PHOEBE: ...Then I've already seen this one! (TURNS OFF TV)

MONICA: (TAKING DRINK FROM JOEY) Are you through with that?

JOEY: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

MONICA: Whose little ball of paper is this?!

CHANDLER: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself,
and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up
and... (OFF MONICA'S LOOK) ...now I wish I was dead.

(MONICA STARTS TO FLUFF A PILLOW)

PHOEBE: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've
already fluffed that- (MON GIVES HER A LOOK) -but, it's fine!

MONICA: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more
ammunition than they already have.

CHANDLER: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the
flatness of a child's pillow.

PHOEBE: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're
like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a
good way.

JOEY: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and
twirly every time they come.

MONICA: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can
do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some
big ceremony before I was born.

CHANDLER: (AT WINDOW) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!

MONICA: What?

CHANDLER: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!

ALL: Eeaagh!

(ENTER RACHEL FROM HER BEDROOM)

RACHEL: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?

PHOEBE: Yeah, it's beautiful.

RACHEL: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (LOOKING UNDER
CUSHIONS)

PHOEBE: No, look, don't touch that!

RACHEL: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give
it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in
the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire
family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring,
without the ring, which makes it so much harder...

MONICA: Easy Rach, we'll find it. (TO ALL) Won't we!

CHANDLER+JOEY: Oh! Yeah!

JOEY: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?

PHOEBE: Doy! Probably right before she lost it!

CHANDLER: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...

RACHEL: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with...

CHANDLER: ...Dinah?

RACHEL: (LOOKING AT THE LASAGNE AND REALISING) Ohhhhh, don't be mad...

MONICA: You didn't.

RACHEL: Oh, I am sorry...

MONICA: I gave you one job! (EXAMINING THE LASAGNE THROUGH THE GLASS
DISH)

RACHEL: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!

CHANDLER: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an
engagement ring in a lasagne...

MONICA: (PUTS DOWN THE lASAGNE) I just... can't do it.

CHANDLER: Boys? We're going in.

(CHANDLER, JOEY+PHOEBE START TO PICK THROUGH THE LASAGNE. A KNOCK AT
THE DOOR. IT IS ROSS)

ROSS: .....Hi.

MONICA: Wow. That is not a happy hi.

ROSS: Carol's pregnant.

PHOEBE: (WHILE EVERYONE ELSE IS STUNNED) Ooh! I found it!

MONICA: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...

ROSS: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am
right about now. (HE COMES IN)

CHANDLER: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?

RACHEL: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?

ROSS: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if
I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved..
basically it's entirely up to me.

PHOEBE: She is so great! I miss her.

MONICA: What does she mean by 'involved'?

CHANDLER: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.

ROSS: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with
them tomorrow.

RACHEL: So what are you gonna do?

ROSS: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be
a father.

(AT THE SOUND OF JOEY EATING THE LASAGNE, THE GANG TURN ROUND TO
STARE AT HIM ACCUSINGLY)

JOEY: .....Well, this is still ruined, right?

SCENE 2: MONICA AND RACHEL'S. (MONICA AND ROSS ARE POURING WINE FOR
MR. AND MRS. GELLER)

MRS. GELLER: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. (TASTING
A SNACK) Mmm! What's that curry taste?

MONICA: Curry.

MRS. GELLER: Mmmm!

ROSS: I- I think they're great! I, I really do.

MR. GELLER: (TO ROSS) Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a
thing for you, didn't she?

MRS. GELLER: They all had a thing for him.

ROSS: Aw, Mom...

MONICA: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?

MRS. GELLER: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something
in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told
her you had a restaurant-

MONICA: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.

MRS. GELLER: Well, they don't have to know that... (SHE STARTS TO
FLUFF THE PILLOWS)

MONICA: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?

ROSS: Yeah. (THEY GO TO THE KITCHEN)

MRS. GELLER: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.

MONICA: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were
you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing?
Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.

(CUT TO THE FAMILY EATING)

MRS. GELLER: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her
parents at the club, they were not playing very well.

MR. GELLER: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding...
but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!

MRS. GELLER: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the
altar...

MONICA: What's that supposed to mean?

MRS. GELLER: Nothing! It's an expression.

MONICA: No it's not.

MR. GELLER: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you
always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you
were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!
And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...

(CUT TO SAME SCENE)

MR. GELLER: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for
the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting
published. Other people are satisfied with staying where
they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never
get cancer.

(AGAIN, CUT TO SAME SCENE)

MR. GELLER: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all,
and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to
have that problem.

MONICA: (TRYING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT) So, Ross, what's going on with
you? Any stories? (DIGS HER ELBOW INTO HIS HAND) No news, no
little anecdotes to share with the folks?

ROSS: (PULLS HIS HAND AWAY) Okay! Okay. (TO MR.+MRS. GELLER) Look, I,
uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly
happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal.
Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan.
She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to
raise the baby.

(STUNNED SILENCE)

MRS. GELLER: (TURNS TO MONICA) And you knew about this?!

(AD BREAK)

SCENE 3: CENTRAL PERK (ALL PRESENT)

JOEY: Your folks are really that bad, huh?

ROSS: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're
doing, they take their time, they get the job done.

MONICA: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy,
if you could- (TO ROSS) -I'd want yours.

ROSS: Must pee. (GOES TO PEE)

PHOEBE: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.

RACHEL: You're twins?

PHOEBE: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven
career type.

CHANDLER: What does she do?

PHOEBE: She's a waitress.

RACHEL: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (THEY START
TO LEAVE)

MONICA: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of
this.

CHANDLER: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who...
my parents actually preferred.

RACHEL: The lights, please.. (JOEY TURNS OFF THE LIGHT. EXIT ALL BUT
RACHEL AND ROSS. RACHEL STARTS TO SWEEP, THEN ROSS COMES
BACK FROM THE TOILET)

ROSS: ...How long was I in there?

RACHEL: I'm just cleaning up.

ROSS: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?

RACHEL: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (SHE HANDS HIM THE BROOM AND THEN
SITS DOWN)

ROSS: Anyway.. um.. (STARTS TO SWEEP) So, you- uh- you nervous about
Barry tomorrow?

RACHEL: Oh.. a little..

ROSS: Mm-hmm..

RACHEL: A lot.

ROSS: Mm.

RACHEL: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been-
dumped?

ROSS: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances
are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know,
so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard.
Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry
back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...

RACHEL: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?

ROSS: Got me.

RACHEL: Remember when we were in high school together?

ROSS: Yeah.

RACHEL: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone,
fall in love- and that'd be it? (ROSS GAZES AT HER) ..Ross?

ROSS: Yes, yes!

RACHEL: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (SHE LEANS BACK ONTO
HIS HAND)

ROSS: Me either... (HE PULLS UP A STOOL AND SITS DOWN SO AS NOT TO
HAVE TO PULL HIS HAND AWAY)

(CUT TO THE CLINIC. CAROL IS SITTING, WAITING. ENTER ROSS)

ROSS: Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big
dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.

(ENTER SUSAN, HOLDING A DRINK)

SUSAN: Hi.

CAROL: Ross, you remember Susan.

ROSS: How could I forget?

SUSAN: Ross.

ROSS: (THEY SHAKE HANDS) Hello, Susan. (TO CAROL) Good shake. Good
shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?

CAROL: Dr. Oberman.

ROSS: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-

SUSAN: She.

ROSS: -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?

CAROL: Yes, and she's very supportive.

ROSS: Okay, that's great. (SUSAN HOLDS OUT HER DRINK) No, I'm- Oh.
(PASSES IT TO CAROL)

CAROL: Thanks.

ROSS: (PICKS UP A SURGICAL IMPLEMENT AND MIMES A DUCK WITH IT) Quack,
quack..

CAROL: Ross? That opens my cervix. (HE DROPS IT IN HORROR)

(CUT TO BARRY'S SURGERY. BARRY IS WORKING ON ROBBIE'S MOUTH. ENTER
RACHEL)

RACHEL: Barry?

BARRY: C'mon in.

RACHEL: (HESITATES) Are you sure?

BARRY: Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

ROBBIE: Huh?!

BARRY: So, how ya doin?

RACHEL: I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!

BARRY: Yeah, well..

BERNICE (OVER INTERCOM): Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.

BARRY (TO INTERCOM): Be right there. (TO ROBBIE+RACHEL) Be back in a
sec.

(ROBBIE STARES AT RACHEL)

RACHEL: I dumped him.

ROBBIE: Okay.

(CUT TO THE CLINIC)

ROSS: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with
us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?

CAROL: Give me a 'for instance'.

ROSS: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh,
with the baby's name?

CAROL: Marlon-

ROSS: Marlon?!

CAROL: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.

ROSS: ...As in Mouse?

CAROL: As in my grandmother.

ROSS: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um..
how about Julia?

CAROL: Julia..

SUSAN: We agreed on Minnie.

ROSS: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives
together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe
Julia's on the table..?

(CUT TO THE SURGERY. RACHEL IS DOING HER MAKEUP IN THE MIRROR ON
BARRY'S LAMP. ENTER BARRY)

BARRY: Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?

RACHEL: Oh, not much. I-I got a job.

BARRY: Oh, that's great.

RACHEL: Why are- why are you so tanned?

BARRY: Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.

RACHEL: Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?

BARRY: No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.

ROBBIE: Me?!

BARRY: No! (TO RACHEL) I went with Mindy.

RACHEL: Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!

BARRY: Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.

RACHEL: Oh! Well, um.. (GRABBING HIS FOREHEAD) You've got plugs!

BARRY: Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.

RACHEL: And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in
your eye!

BARRY: Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

RACHEL: Okay..

BARRY: See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've
ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.

RACHEL: Wow.

BARRY: You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We
weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.

RACHEL: What?

ROBBIE: Me. (SPITS)

RACHEL: Anyway, um, (GETS THE RING OUT OF HER PURSE) I guess this
belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.

BARRY: Well, thank you for giving it back.

(BARRY AND RACHEL SMILE AT EACH OTHER FOR A BIT)

ROBBIE: Hello?!

(CUT TO THE CLINIC)

SUSAN: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?

ROSS: Helen Geller? I don't think so.

CAROL: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

ROSS: Thank you!

CAROL: No, I mean it's not Geller.

ROSS: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?

CAROL: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.

ROSS: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?

SUSAN: It's my baby too.

ROSS: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.

SUSAN: Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!

CAROL: All right, you two, stop it!

ROSS: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.

CAROL: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller?
'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.

ROSS: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.

SUSAN: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's
gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her
Geller, then he gets his way!

ROSS: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the
ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not
my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't
do-

DR. OBERMAN: (ENTERING) Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?

ALL: Yeah. Yeah. A little.

DR. OBERMAN: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but..
thanks for sharing. (TO CAROL) Uh, lie back..

ROSS: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I
can be involved in this particular thing right now. (HE TURNS
TO GO, BUT THE SOUND OF THE SONOGRAM CATCHES HIS EAR; HE RETURNS
AND STARES AT IT, TRANSFIXED)

ROSS: Oh my God.

SUSAN: Look at that.

CAROL: I know.

CREDITS SCENE: MONICA+RACHEL'S APARTMENT.(ALL WATCHING A VIDEO OF THE
SONOGRAM)

ROSS: Well? Isn't that amazing?

JOEY: What are we supposed to be seeing here?

CHANDLER: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.

PHOEBE: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your
eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.

ROSS: Then don't do that, alright?

PHOEBE: Okay!

ROSS: (WALKING OVER TO WHERE MONICA IS STANDING) Monica. Whaddya
think?

MONICA: (WELLING UP) Mm-hmm.

ROSS: Wh- are you welling up?

MONICA: No.

ROSS: You are, you're welling up.

MONICA: Am not!

ROSS: You're gonna be an aunt.

MONICA: (PUSHES HIM AND STARTS TO CRY) Oh shut up!

RACHEL: (ON PHONE) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine.
I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no,
it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh,
oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you
guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything-
I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.
(SLAMS DOWN PHONE) (TO THE GANG, WHO ARE STARING) Okay, I
know it was a cheap shot, but I feel SO much better now.

PRE-INTRO SCENE: CENTRAL PERK

PHOEBE: (ENTERING) Hi guys!

ALL: Hey, Pheebs! Hi!

ROSS: Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?

PHOEBE: Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We
should do this again!'

ALL: Ohh. Ouch.

RACHEL: What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?

MONICA: Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means
'You will never see me naked'.

RACHEL: Since when?

JOEY: Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not
you' means 'It is you'.

CHANDLER: Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating
leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to
you'.

PHOEBE: Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people'
means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.

RACHEL: And everybody knows this?

JOEY: Yeah. Cushions the blow.

CHANDLER: Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your
dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some
farm.

ROSS: That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did,
uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.

MONICA: Uh, Ross.

ROSS: What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The
Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses,
and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh
my God, Chi Chi!

(INTRO)

SCENE 1: CHANDLER AND JOEY'S APARTMENT. (JOEY IS REHEARSING A PART;
CHANDLER READS THE OTHER PART FROM A SCRIPT)

CHANDLER: "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"

JOEY: "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have
to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."

CHANDLER: Hey, that was really good!

JOEY: Thanks! Let's keep going.

CHANDLER: Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"

JOEY: "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can
smoke."

CHANDLER: "Smoke away."

(JOEY TAKES OUT A PACKET OF CIGARETTES AND A LIGHTER. HE FUMBLES
AND DROPS THE LIGHTER. THEN HE LIGHTS A CIGARETTE, TAKES A DRAG AND
COUGHS)

CHANDLER: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell
alone.

JOEY: What?

CHANDLER: Relax your hand!

(JOEY LETS HIS WRIST GO LIMP)

CHANDLER: Not so much!

JOEY: Whoah!

CHANDLER: Hey!

JOEY: Hey!

CHANDLER: Alright, now try taking a puff.

(JOEY TRIES AND VISIBLY WINCES)

CHANDLER: Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.

JOEY: No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.

CHANDLER: It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or
not? Here.

(JOEY RELUCTANTLY GIVES HIM THE CIGARETTE)

CHANDLER: Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing
that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it,
you feel right. You feel complete.

JOEY: Y'miss it?

CHANDLER: Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (TAKES A PUFF)
Oh.. my.. God. (CONTINUES TO SMOKE)

SCENE 2: CENTRAL PERK(ALL PRESENT EXCEPT RACHEL AND PHOEBE)

MONICA: No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the
tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.

(THE GUYS STRETCH OUT THEIR FINGERS)

JOEY: That's ridiculous!

ROSS: Can I use.. either thumb?

RACHEL: (BRINGING DRINKS) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!
(HANDING THEM OUT) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black..
Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!

ALL: Yeah. Yeah, excellent.

RACHEL: (LEAVING TO SERVE OTHERS) Good for me!

(THE GANG SWAP ROUND ALL THE DRINKS)

(ENTER PHOEBE, MUTTERING. SHE SITS DOWN WITHOUT SAYING HI)

JOEY: Y'okay, Phoebe?

PHOEBE: Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.

MONICA: What did they do to you?

PHOEBE: It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and
I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-

ROSS: Easy.

PHOEBE: - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.

CHANDLER: Oh, Satan's minions at work again...

PHOEBE: Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.

JOEY: What are you talking about? Keep it!

PHOEBE: It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be
like stealing.

RACHEL: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!

PHOEBE: Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes.
Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine.
Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and
skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-
mine'...

MONICA: We're with you. We got it.

(CHANDLER LEANS OVER THE BACK OF THE COUCH, OUT OF SIGHT)

PHOEBE: Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be
like this giant karmic debt.

RACHEL: Chandler, what are you doing?

MONICA: (PULLING HIM UP) Hey. Whaddya doing?

(CHANDLER TRIES TO SHRUG NONCHALANTLY BUT EVENTUALLY HE HAS TO EXHALE
A MOUTHFUL OF SMOKE)

ALL: Oh! Oh, God!

ROSS: What is this?!

CHANDLER: I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.

PHOEBE: Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!

CHANDLER: And this- is my reward!

ROSS: Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went
through the last time you quit.

CHANDLER: Okay, so this time I won't quit!

ALL: Ohhh! Put it out!

CHANDLER: All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (HE
DROPS IT IN PHOEBE'S COFFEE)

PHOEBE: Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!

MONICA: Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.

RACHEL: This Alan again? How's it goin'?

MONICA: 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having
fun.

JOEY: So when do we get to meet the guy?

MONICA: Let's see, today's Monday... Never.

ALL: Oh, come on! Come on!

MONICA: No. Not after what happened with Steve.

CHANDLER: What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was
schhexy!.. Sorry.

MONICA: Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me
a chance to figure that out.

RACHEL: Well, then can we meet him?

MONICA: Nope. Schhorry.

SCENE 3: IRIDIUM (MONICA AND PAULA ARE AT WORK)

MONICA: I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy
home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean,
they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the
herd.

PAULA: Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad
beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I
mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.

MONICA: I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they
actually liked.

PAULA: Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little
slimmer if they never get to meet the guy..

(CUT TO RACHEL+MONICA'S APARTMENT. CHANDLER IS SMOKING ON THE BALCONY,
PHOEBE IS ABSENT)

JOEY: Let it go, Ross.

ROSS: Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.

MONICA: Do you all promise?

ALL: Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!

MONICA: (SHOUTS TO CHANDLER) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?

(CHANDLER MAKES A 'CROSS MY HEART' SIGN. IT STARTS TO RAIN AND
CHANDLER TAPS ON THE WINDOW)

JOEY: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to
stay outside!

(CHANDLER SULKILY PICKS UP A GARBAGE CAN LID AND SHELTERS HIMSELF
UNDER IT)

(ENTER PHOEBE. SHE STRIDES TO THE COUCH, SITS DOWN AND BEGINS TO
READ WITHOUT SAYING HI)

ROSS: Hey, Pheebs.

PHOEBE: 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our
error. We have credited your account with five hundred
dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll
accept this- (SEARCHES IN HER PURSE) -football phone as our
free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand
dollars, and a football phone!

RACHEL: What bank is this?

(DOOR BUZZER)

MONICA: Hey. It's him. (TO INTERCOM) Who is it?

ALAN (INTERCOM): It's Alan.

JOEY: (SHOUTS TO CHANDLER) Chandler! He's here!

(CHANDLER COMES IN, DRIPPING WET)

MONICA: (TO ALL) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much
you all like me.

(OPENS THE DOOR- ENTER ALAN)

MONICA: Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.

ALAN: Hi.

ALL: Hi, Alan.

ALAN: I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!

(GENERAL HYSTERIA)

SCENE 4: RACHEL+ MONICA'S (LATER IN THE EVENING)

MONICA: (AT THE DOOR, TO ALAN, WHO IS LEAVING) Thanks. I'll call you
tomorrow. (TO ALL) Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing
begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?

(SILENCE)

MONICA: C'mon!

ROSS: ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm
sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.

ALL: Loved him! Yeah! He's great!

MONICA: Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out
with?

ALL: Yeah!

RACHEL: And did you notice...? (SPREADS HER THUMB AND INDEX FINGER)

THE GUYS: (RELUCTANTLY) Yeah.

JOEY: Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.

PHOEBE: Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!

ROSS: ...What shoe?

PHOEBE: From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a
crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'

(DUBIOUS PAUSE)

ROSS: ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all
future boyfriends will be measured.

RACHEL: What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be,
y'know, it.

MONICA: Really!

CHANDLER: Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof
impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at
parties, right? (DOES IT)

ROSS: You know what I like most about him, though?

ALL: What?

ROSS: The way he makes me feel about myself.

ALL: Yeah...

(AD BREAK)

SCENE 5: CENTRAL PERK(MONICA ALONE. ENTER ROSS, RACHEL, CHANDLER AND
JOEY, DEJECTEDLY, IN SOFTBALL GEAR)

MONICA: Hi.. how was the game?

ROSS: Well..

ALL: WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!

MONICA: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?

JOEY: Alan.

ROSS: He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny
cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but
instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan,
third base-...

RACHEL: I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.

CHANDLER: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two
about softball..

MONICA: Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is
maybe.. sometimes..

ROSS: What?

MONICA: ..I dunno, a little too Alan?

RACHEL: Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.

ROSS: Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.

CHANDLER: I personally could have a gallon of Alan.

(CUT TO A STREET WHERE LIZZIE IS RESTING. PHOEBE WALKS UP TO HER)

PHOEBE: Hey, Lizzie.

LIZZIE: Hey, Weird Girl.

PHOEBE: I brought you alphabet soup.

LIZZIE: Did you pick out the vowels?

PHOEBE: Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh,
I also have something else for you. (SEARCHES IN HER PURSE)

LIZZIE: Saltines?

PHOEBE: No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football
phone?

LIZZIE: What? (OPENS THE ENVELOPE PHOEBE HAS GIVEN HER) Oh my God,
there's really money in here.

PHOEBE: I know.

LIZZIE: Weird Girl, what are you doing?

PHOEBE: No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.

LIZZIE: No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.

PHOEBE: Oh, that's fine, no.

LIZZIE: Would you like my tin-foil hat?

PHOEBE: No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.

LIZZIE: Please, let me do something.

PHOEBE: Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?

LIZZIE: Okay.

PHOEBE: Okay.

(CUT TO CHANDLER'S OFFICE BLOCK)

(CHANDLER LOOKS ROUND, THEN OPENS HIS DESK DRAWER AND TAKES A PUFF OF
A CIGARETTE. THEN HE SPRAYS AROUND SOME AIR FRESHENER AND TAKES SOME
BREATH SPRAY. HE TYPES FOR A MOMENT. THEN HE OPENS THE DRAWER AGAIN
AND TAKES ANOTHER PUFF. NOT PAYING ATTENTION, HE SPRAYS THE BREATH
SPRAY AROUND THE ROOM, TAKES A SQUIRT OF AIR FRESHENER AND GAGS)

(CUT TO PHOEBE AND LIZZIE AT A SODA STAND)

LIZZIE: Keep the change. (TO PHOEBE) Sure you don't wanna pretzel?

PHOEBE: No, I'm fine.

LIZZIE: (LEAVING) See ya.

(PHOEBE OPENS THE CAN AND REACTS)

PHOEBE: Huh!

(CUT TO CENTRAL PERK)

ROSS: A thumb?!

(PHOEBE NODS)

ALL: Eww!

PHOEBE: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just
floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!

CHANDLER: Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?

PHOEBE: Does, um, anyone wanna see?

ALL: Nooo!

(CHANDLER LIGHTS A CIGARETTE)

ALL: Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!

RACHEL: It's worse than the thumb!

CHANDLER: Hey, this is so unfair!

MONICA: Oh, why is it unfair?

CHANDLER: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant
knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his
over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that
snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing?
...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for
this?

(UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE)

JOEY: ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?

RACHEL: Well, I-I could live without it.

JOEY: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe
chews her hair?

(PHOEBE SPITS OUT HER HAIR)

ROSS: Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.

JOEY: Oh, (IMITATING ROSS) "you do, do you"?

(MONICA LAUGHS AND SNORTS)

ROSS: You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.

RACHEL: "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.

PHOEBE: Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually
ordered.

RACHEL: Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.

(THEY DEGENERATE INTO BICKERING AND CHANDLER HAPPILY STARTS TO SMOKE,
UNDISTURBED.)

SCENE 6: IRIDIUM (AGAIN, MONICA AND PAULA AT WORK)

MONICA: Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?

PAULA: No.

MONICA: Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really
like.

PAULA: Wait wait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow
got through!

MONICA: Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the
thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.

PAULA: Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's
how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!

MONICA: I know.. it's gonna be really hard.

PAULA: Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.

MONICA: No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.

(CUT TO CENTRAL PERK, WHERE JOEY AND ROSS ARE PERSECUTING CHANDLER)

JOEY: Do you have any respect for your body?

ROSS: Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?

CHANDLER: Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer
and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line
is, smoking is cool, and you know it.

RACHEL: (WITH PHONE) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.

CHANDLER: Really? He does? (TAKES PHONE) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh,
she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now
and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well,
that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it
like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (HANDS BACK THE PHONE
AND STUBS OUT HIS CIGARETTE)

RACHEL: (TO ROSS, WHO HAS WANDERED UP) God, he's good.

ROSS: If only he were a woman.

RACHEL: Yeah.

(THEY GIVE EACH OTHER A DUBIOUS LOOK)

(CUT TO THE GANG MINUS MONICA AND JOEY WATCHING LAMBCHOP AT RACHEL+
MONICA'S)

CHANDLER: Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my
hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.

ROSS: Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.
(DOES SO)

(ENTER MONICA)

MONICA: Hey. Where's Joey?

CHANDLER: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you
think that was wrong?

RACHEL: I think he's across the hall.

MONICA: Thanks. (GOES TO FETCH HIM)

ROSS: (FINISHES CHANGING CHANDLER'S NICOTINE PATCH) There y'go.

CHANDLER: (DEADPAN) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.

ROSS: Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?

PHOEBE: Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?

ROSS: Hey, I might!

PHOEBE: Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven
thousand dollars for the thumb.

ALL: You're kidding. Oh my God.

PHOEBE: And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with
the universe?!

JOEY: (DRAGGED IN BY MONICA. HE HAS JUST COME OUT OF THE SHOWER)
What's going on?

MONICA: Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.

JOEY: Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..

RACHEL: Uh, Joey..

JOEY: Oh, God! (HURRIEDLY CLOSES HIS KNEES)

MONICA: (TURNS OFF TV) Okay..

ALL: Oh! That was Lambchop!

MONICA: Please, guys, we have to talk.

PHOEBE: Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.

MONICA: Alright, we have to talk.

PHOEBE: There it is!

MONICA: Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should
know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh..
I've decided to break up with Alan.

(THEY ALL GASP AND CLUTCH EACH OTHER)

ROSS: Is there somebody else?

MONICA: No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.

RACHEL: We didn't change..

JOEY: So that's it? It's over? Just like that?

PHOEBE: You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care
about someone, and I just- I- (CHEWS HER HAIR)

MONICA: Look, I- I could go on pretending-

JOEY: Okay!

MONICA: -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to
Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!

ROSS: Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the
way they were.

MONICA: I'm sorry..

CHANDLER: (SARCASTIC) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!

RACHEL: (TEARFUL) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays
coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-

MONICA: I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.

ALL: Oh, yeah! Right!

MONICA: Are you guys gonna be okay?

ROSS: Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.

MONICA: (DUBIOUS) I understand.

(CUT TO MONICA TELLING ALAN IN A RESTAURANT)

ALAN: Wow.

MONICA: I'm, I'm really sorry.

ALAN: Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little
relieved.

MONICA: Relieved?

ALAN: Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand
your friends.

That was fun.

MONICA: Hi.

ALL: Mmm.

ROSS: So how'd it go?

MONICA: Oh, y'know..

PHOEBE: Did he mention us?

MONICA: He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (DUBIOUS LOOK)

ROSS: You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (SHE SITS DOWN AND ROSS
STROKES HER FOREHEAD)

CHANDLER: ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.

ALL: No no no!

CHANDLER: (LEAVING) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over!
I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!

PHOEBE: (SHOUTS AS HE LEAVES) If you never smoke again I'll give you
seven thousand dollars!

CHANDLER: (REENTERING) Yeah, alright.

PRE-INTRO-SCENE: CENTRAL PERK (ALL PRESENT EXCEPT JOEY)

MONICA: Alright. Phoebe?

PHOEBE: Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um,
world peace, no more hunger, good things for the
rain-forest...And bigger boobs!

ROSS: Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?

CHANDLER: Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself
omnipotent forever.

RACHEL: See, there's always one guy. (MOCKING) "If I had a wish,
I'd wish for three more wishes."

(ENTER JOEY)

ALL: Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.

MONICA: Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?

JOEY: Probably kill myself!

MONICA: ..Excuse me?

JOEY: Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!

ROSS: Joey, uh- OMnipotent.

JOEY: You are? Ross, I'm sorry..

(INTRO)

SCENE 1: CENTRAL PERK (ROSS AND MONICA ARE WATCHING PHOEBE SLEEP)

MONICA: How does she do that?

ROSS: I cannot sleep in a public place.

MONICA: Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.

PHOEBE: (WAKING AND STARTLING THEM) Oh! What what what! ...Hi.

ROSS: It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.

MONICA: What's going on with you?

PHOEBE: I got no sleep last night!

ROSS: Why?

PHOEBE: My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind
of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly,
like, having to reassure each other that they're having a
good time. You have no idea how loud they are!

MONICA: Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.

PHOEBE: Thanks.

(ENTER CHANDLER AND JOEY. JOEY IS COUNTING HIS STEPS)

JOEY: ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less
than a hundred steps from our place to here.

CHANDLER: You got waaaay too much free time.

JOEY: (TO ROSS) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out:
hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and
we're taking you.

CHANDLER: Happy birthday, pal!

JOEY: We love you, man. (KISSES HIM)

ROSS: Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.

JOEY: So?

ROSS: So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide
which one of you got to bring a date?

CHANDLER: Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty".

ROSS: Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?

MONICA: Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.

ROSS: Ohhh.

JOEY: What's wrong with the twentieth?

CHANDLER: Eleven days before Hallowe'en.. all the good costumes are
gone?

ROSS: Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical
relationship. (JOEY IS PUZZLED) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd
better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and
think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

JOEY: The hell with hockey, let's all do that!

CHANDLER: (TRYING TO STOP ROSS LEAVING) C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey,
ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy,
(PRETENDING TO PUNCH HIM IN THE STOMACH) huh? huh? huh?

ROSS: What are you doing?

CHANDLER: (STOPS) I have no idea.

JOEY: C'mon, Ross!

ROSS: Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you
promise to buy me a big thumb finger?

CHANDLER: You got it.

(RACHEL RUNS UP CLUTCHING AN ENVELOPE)

RACHEL: Look look look look look, my first pay check! Look at the
window, there's my name! Hi, me!

PHOEBE: I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave
in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.

MONICA: Wow, you worked in a mine?

PHOEBE: I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?

RACHEL: God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for
it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally- (OPENS
ENVELOPE) -not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my
money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.

CHANDLER: (LOOKING) Oh, this is not that bad.

JOEY: Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.

ROSS: You can totally, totally live on this.

MONICA: Yeah, yeah.

ROSS: Oh, by the way, great service tonight.

RACHEL: What are you guys doing here?

KIKI: Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work
here, aaand it's true!

JOANNE: Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.

RACHEL: (TO (PREGNANT) LESLIE) Look at you, you are so big I can't
believe it!

LESLIE: I know. I know! I'm a duplex.

RACHEL: (TO JOANNE) So what's going on with you?

JOANNE: Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm? (POINTS
TO HERSELF; THEY ALL SCREAM)

KIKI: And while we're on the subject of news.. (HOLDS UP HER FINGER

CHANDLER: ...Poulet passes it up to Leech! (PASSES TO JOEY)

JOEY: Leech spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass! (KICKS IT
TO ROSS, BUT ROSS IS STARING INTO A SHOP WINDOW)

CHANDLER: We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at
some women's shoes.

ROSS: Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we
first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause
we-we- (OFF CHANDLER'S LOOK) Sorry. Sorry.

(THEY WALK ON. CHANDLER AND JOEY START TO TALK BUT ROSS STOPS AND
WHINES)

JOEY: What?

ROSS: Peach pit.

CHANDLER: Yes, Bunny?

ROSS: (POINTS) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-

JOEY: -Peaches?

ROSS: Actually, nectarines, but basically..

CHANDLER: (TO JOEY) Could've been a peach.

ROSS: Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-
(LOOKS UP, REALISES, AND POINTS) -the bus stop... I'm fine.

JOEY: Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! (THEY TURN TO STARE
AT HIM) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.

(CUT TO CENTRAL PERK- RACHEL, LESLIE, KIKI AND JOANNE TALKING)

RACHEL: So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!

KIKI: Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!

JOANNE: Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.

RACHEL: Okay.

JOANNE: When are you coming home?

RACHEL: What? Guys, I'm not.

JOANNE: C'mon, this is us.

RACHEL: I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-

KIKI: Waitressing?

RACHEL: Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the
specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I
take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um,
sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies
on the cookies.

LESLIE: Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.

SCENE 3: MONICA AND RACHEL'S (PHOEBE AND MONICA ARE IN PAJAMAS.

SCREAM) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
(POURS THE CONTENTS OF THE BLENDER INTO GLASSES)

RACHEL: What's that?

MONICA: Weeeell, it's rum, and-

RACHEL: Okay. (GRABS THE BLENDER AND STARTS TO DRINK)

MONICA: We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have
kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy
magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister.. (PHONE
RINGS, MONICA GOES TO ANSWER)

PHOEBE: Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the
tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!

MONICA: Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.

RACHEL: Oh, God, ask them what they want.

MONICA: (PHONE) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to?
...Yes, hold on. (TO RACH) Um, they say there's been some
unusual activity on your account.

RACHEL: But I haven't used my card in weeks!

MONICA: That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if
you're okay.

RACHEL: They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm
okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took
all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or
getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee!
And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay,
okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?

MONICA: (PAUSES, THEN, TO PHONE) Uh- Rachel has left the building,
can you call back?

RACHEL: Alright, c'mon! (MISERABLY) Let's play Twister!

SCENE 4: THE GUYS AT THE GAME (TRYING TO FIND THEIR SEATS)

ROSS: (SQUEEZING PAST PEOPLE) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.

CHANDLER: What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic
seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

ROSS: No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting
together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that
night... It was the first frost...

JOEY: C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.

(CUT TO THE GIRLS)

MONICA: You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this
amazing independence thing!

RACHEL: Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And
for what?

PHOEBE: You are just like Jack.

RACHEL: ...Jack from downstairs?

PHOEBE: No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

MONICA: Ah, the other Jack.

PHOEBE: Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those
magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this
big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and
stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the
Village..

RACHEL: Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an
orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-

PHOEBE: Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.

RACHEL: But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured
out, and now everything's just kinda like-

PHOEBE: Floopy?

RACHEL: Yeah.

MONICA: So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we
don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at
some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna
be... un-floopy.

PHOEBE: Oh, like that's a word.

RACHEL: Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?

MONICA: ...Pheebs?

PHOEBE: Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.

RACHEL: Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I
mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?

(CUT TO THE GAME)

ROSS: Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya

CHANDLER: (TO ROSS) See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of
toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.

ROSS: Pass it! Pass it!

CHANDLER: He's open!

ALL: Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

(THE PLAYER SHOOTS. THE PUCK FLIES OFF THE RINK AND HITS ROSS IN THE

SCENE 5: EMERGENCY ROOM (CHANDLER AND JOEY LEADING ROSS IN)

CHANDLER: (TO RECEPTIONIST)'Scuse me.

RECEPTIONIST: (HOLDS UP HER HAND- SHE IS ON THE PHONE) It says to
call this number if you're not completely satisfied with
this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

CHANDLER: Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know
that, or we'd be in the predicament room.

(RECEPTIONIST GIVES HIM A LOOK TO FREEZE HELL)

RECEPTIONIST: (TO PHONE) Hold on. (TO CHANDLER) Fill these out, sit
over there. (TOSSES HIM SOME FORMS)

ROSS: (JUMPS TO HIS FEET) Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay,
but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.

RECEPTIONIST: Well, you'll have to wait your turn.

JOEY: Well, how long do you think it'll be?

RECEPTIONIST: (SARCASTIC) Any minute now.

ROSS: Hey, this- (SHE GIVES HIM A LOOK AND THE GUYS BACK OFF)
Heyy...

(CUT TO THE GIRLS)

MONICA: No, you were right. I don't have a plan. (A KNOCK AT THE DOOR)

PIZZA GUY (OUTSIDE): Pizza guy.

RACHEL: Thank God. Food. (SHE GOES TO GET IT)

MONICA: Phoebe?

PHOEBE: What?

MONICA: Do you have a plan?

PHOEBE: I don't even have a 'pl'.

PIZZA GUY: Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?

RACHEL: (MISERABLE) No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered
a fat-free crust with extra cheese.

PIZZA GUY: Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos'? Man, my dad's gonna
kill me!

MONICA: (LEAPS THE COUCH AND RUNS UP) Wait! Did you say
'G.Stephanopoulos'?

PIZZA GUY: Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given
him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!

MONICA: Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously
intelligent good looks?

PIZZA GUY: Yeah, that sounds about right.

MONICA: Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?

PHOEBE: And-and a power tie?

PIZZA GUY: No, pretty much just a towel.

MONICA: (STAGGERED) Oh God.

PIZZA GUY: So you guys want me to take this back?

MONICA: Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!

(RACHEL PAYS HIM. MONICA GRABS SOME BINOCULARS AND RUNS TO THE WINDOW)

RACHEL: Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?

PHOEBE: Big Bird's friend.

MONICA: I see pizza!

PHOEBE: Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (RUNS UP AND TAKES THE
BINOCULARS)

RACHEL: Hello? Who are we spying on?

MONICA: White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the
great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?

RACHEL: Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!

PHOEBE: Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.

MONICA: Please tell me it's his mother.

PHOEBE: Definitely not his mother.

MONICA: Oh, no...

PHOEBE: Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking..
she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (YELLS) Hey, that's
not for you, bitch!

(PHOEBE COVERS HER MOUTH WITH HER HAND AND WALKS AWAY FROM THE WINDOW)

(CUT TO THE HOSPITAL. JOEY IS MIMING HOCKEY PUCKS HITTING FOREHEADS.
CHANDLER REALISES IT'S GETTING TENSE AND GOES TO THE RECEPTIONIST
AGAIN)

CHANDLER: Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a
lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean,
that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with?

(SHE SLIDES THE GLASS PANEL OVER. CHANDLER TALKS THROUGH IT IN A LOUD
VOICE)

CHANDLER: Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some
things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't
love each other. (TO THE E.R.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost
her.. (SHE SLIDES THE PANEL BACK. HE TURNS AND IT TAKES HIM
BY SURPRISE) Ba-!

(CUT TO THE GIRLS ON MON+RACH'S BALCONY)

MONICA: Light still out?

RACHEL: Yeah.

MONICA: Oh. Maybe they're- napping.

RACHEL: Oh please, they're having sex.

MONICA+PHOEBE: Shut up!

RACHEL: So, whaddya think George is like?

MONICA: I think he's shy.

PHOEBE: Yeah?

MONICA: Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you
do- he's a preppy animal.

(HOSPITAL)

ROSS: I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her
face had the most incredible glow.

CHANDLER: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this
part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?

JOEY: He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today?
So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept
with her for seven years after that.

ROSS: Look, it's just a little more complicated...

CHANDLER: Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she
likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes
women?

ROSS: Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor
in a coma that didn't quite hear you...

CHANDLER: Then what?

ROSS: My first time with Carol was.. (MUMBLES)

JOEY: What?

ROSS: It was my first time.

JOEY: With Carol?

(ROSS GIVES HIM A LOOK)

JOEY: Oh.

CHANDLER: So in your whole life, you've only been with one- (HE GETS
A LOOK TOO) -oh.

JOEY: Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch
of stuff we could've done tonight!

(BALCONY)

MONICA: Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate
that I made that you loved so much?

PHOEBE: Uh-huh.

MONICA: Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!

PHOEBE: Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about
sleeping with Jason Hurley.

MONICA: What?! You slept with Jason?

PHOEBE: You'd already broken up.

RACHEL: How long?

PHOEBE: A couple hours.

MONICA: Oh, that's nice!

RACHEL: Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (SHE SITS UP AND THE CUSHION SHE
WAS LEANING AGAINST FALLS OFF THE BALCONY) Anyway- The
valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from
me.

MONICA: Excuse me?!

RACHEL: Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? (TO PHOEBE) She
was a big girl.

MONICA: Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants
in seventh grade!

RACHEL: I was laughing! You made me laugh! (MONICA AND RACHEL START
TO SQUABBLE)

PHOEBE: There he is! There he is!

MONICA: Where?

PHOEBE: Right- where we've been looking all night!

RACHEL: He is so cute!

MONICA: Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!

ALL: Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the- (PAUSE) -wowww.

(HOSPITAL- ROSS IS ABSENT)

JOEY: Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?

CHANDLER: I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic..

JOEY: Really?

CHANDLER: No, you kidding? The guy's a freak..

(ENTER ROSS OFF CAMERA)

BOTH: Hey, buddy.

ROSS: Hi. (HE IS WEARING A PIECE OF STEEL BANDAGED TO HIS NOSE. HE
TOSSES SOME FORMS ONTO THE RECEPTION DESK)

RECEPTIONIST: (SARCASTIC) Oh, that's attractive.

CHANDLER: Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh
come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun
tonight.

ROSS: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was
the fun part? Where's my puck?

JOEY: Oh, ah- the kid has it.

ROSS: The kid..? (TO KID) Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.

KID: I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.

(ROSS LOOKS AT CHANDLER FOR HELP)

CHANDLER: You gotta do it, man.

ROSS: (TO KID) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever- (TO
CHANDLER) -can't do it. (TO KID) Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.

KID: No.

ROSS: 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!

KID: No! No!

(THEY FIGHT OVER IT.)

RECEPTIONIST: Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!

ROSS: (TRIES TO SNATCH IT-) GIVE ME MY PUCK!! (-BUT IT FLIES OUT OF
HIS GRASP AND KNOCKS OUT THE RECEPTIONIST)

ROSS: ...Now that was fun.

CREDITS SCENE: RACHEL+MONICA'S PLACE (JOEY AND THE GIRLS ARE PLAYING
TWISTER)

ROSS: (DOING THE SPINNING) Okay, Monica: Right foot red.

MONICA: Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.

(A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. CHANDLER OPENS IT AND SOME GUY SILENTLY HANDS
BACK THE CUSHION)

CHANDLER: Thanks. (THE GUY NODS AND LEAVES)

ROSS: Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. (PHOEBE HAS TO BEND OVER.)Good.
(JOEY STARES AT HER BUTT APPRECIATIVELY)

(PHONE RINGS, CHANDLER ANSWERS)

CHANDLER: Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.

RACHEL: Oh, okay. Will you take my place?

CHANDLER: Alright. (TO PHONE) Yes, this is Rachel.

RACHEL: Nooo! (TAKES THE PHONE; CHANDLER TAKES HER PLACE) Hello? Oh,
yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well,
thanks, but, I'm okay, really.

ROSS: Green. To the green.

RACHEL: I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.

CHANDLER: To the left, to the left- aww! (THEY COLLAPSE)

RACHEL: Ohhh... I'm fine.

[Scene: Central Perk. All six are there.]

MNCA: Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.

ROSS: Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there,
there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the
sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing
a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?

RACH: Come on! You guys can pee standing up.

CHAN: We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.

JOEY: Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any
time they want. You just look down and there they are. How
you get any work done is beyond me.

PHOE: Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many
mean things, and then not even care.

[Long pause.]

ROSS: Multiple orgasms!

 

Opening Credits
[Scene: Central Perk. All are there.]

CHAN: So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night,
Sat-ur-day night!

JOEY: No plans, huh?

CHAN: Not a one.

ROSS: Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?

CHAN: Oh, right, right, shut up.

MNCA: Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just
gotta do it.

CHAN: No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're
sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening,
and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's
the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.

JOEY: Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop
calling.

PHOE: You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.

CHAN: Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.

PHOE: No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.

ROSS: Tony?

MNCA: Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?

PHOE: Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you
know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I
don't know.

RACH: [waitressing] Does anybody want anything else?

ROSS: Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey
kind of a cakey pie thing. [Rachel gives him a dirty look]
Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.

PHOE: [to Rachel] What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?

RACH: It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.

ROSS: That guy, he burns me up.

RACH: Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was
horrible. He called me young lady.

CHAN: Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.

MNCA: Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?

RACH: Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version,
with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".

PHOE: [rhythmically] Uh-huh, uh-huh.

[Angela (ANGL), a beautiful woman in a tight dress, enters.]

ANGL: Hi, Joey.

JOEY: My god, Angela.

[Angela takes a seat at the counter.]

MNCA: Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.

PHOE: Are you gonna go over there?

JOEY: No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager.
One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That
seems pretty cool. [he walks over to her] Hey, Angela.

ANGL: [casually] Joey.

JOEY: You look good.

ANGL: That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.

JOEY: You don't say.

[Cut to Ross and Rachel, talking next to one of the tables.]

ROSS: So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?

RACH: Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at laundorama.

ROSS: Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's
doing laundry there too?

RACH: Who?

ROSS: Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just
join you both, here?

RACH: Don't you have a laundry room in your building?

ROSS: Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's
a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer
sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out
all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?

RACH: Sure.

[Cut back to Joey and Angela at the counter.]

ANGL: Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.

JOEY: Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

ANGL: Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a
real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call
yourself an actor, but Bob--

JOEY: Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff,
but like, talking too.

ANGL: Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so
guess what?

JOEY: What?

ANGL: We're just friends.

JOEY: Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner
together tonight? You know, as friends?

ANGL: What four of us?

JOEY: You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment. Joey is there, trying to
convince Monica to pose as his girlfriend. His plan is to hook Monica
up with Angela's boyfriend Bob and then take Angela back for himself.]

JOEY: Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.

MNCA: Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.

JOEY: Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's...
brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real
job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an
actor, but Bob is--

MNCA: [looking out window] Oh, god help us.

JOEY: What?

MNCA: Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!

JOEY: Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her
brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.

MNCA: What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.

JOEY: [proud] I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should
have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?

[Scene: Ross' apartment. Chandler is over.]

ROSS: [on phone] Ok, bye. [hangs up] Well, Monica's not coming,
it's just gonna be me and Rachel.

CHAN: Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this
thing through?

ROSS: It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.

CHAN: It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a
date. You're going on a date.

ROSS: Nuh-uh.

CHAN: Yuh-huh.

ROSS: So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up
some wine, what?

CHAN: Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is
basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear--do
you want it to be dirty?

ROSS: [sheepish] No.

CHAN: Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?

ROSS: Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm
a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear.
Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.

CHAN: There you go.

[Scene: A fancy restaurant. Joey and Monica are there, meeting
Angela and Bob, who Monica thinks is Angela's brother.]

MNCA: Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall?
Short?

JOEY: Yep.

MNCA: Which?

JOEY: Which what?

MNCA: You've never met Bob, have you?

JOEY: No, but he's--

MNCA: Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly--

[Angela and Bob walk in. Bob is good-looking.]

ANGL: Hey, Joey.

MNCA: --horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.

[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler and Phoebe are there, both ready to
break up with their significant others.]

CHAN: Where are they? Where are they?

PHOE: This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.

CHAN: It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over
some puppies.

PHOE: Eww, I don't wanna do that.

[Janice (JNCE) and Phoebe's boyfriend, Tony, walk in.]

CHAN: Here we go.

PHOE: Ok, have a good break-up.

CHAN: Hey, Janice.

JNCE: Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most
supremely awful day.

CHAN: Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte
over here, please?

JNCE: We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know,
the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty
much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went
shopping...[looks through her bags]... and I got you, I'm
looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...

[Chandler sees Phoebe breaking up with Tony. She talks to him for
a few seconds, hugs him, and then he leaves. Chandler is amazed
how easy it was for her.]

CHAN: What?

JNCE: What?

CHAN: [covering] What... did you get me there?

JNCE: I got you--these. [pulls out a pair of socks]

CHAN: Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.

JNCE: Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know,
you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky
and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel.
Whatever you want.

CHAN: That's great.

[The drinks arrive, and Chandler downs his espresso in one gulp.]

CHAN: Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another
latte?

JNCE: [holding the full cup] No, no, I'm still working on mine.

[Chandler walks over to the counter where Phoebe is, and is asking
her about the break-up.]

CHAN: That's it?

PHOE: Yeah, it was really hard.

CHAN: Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.

PHOE: Ok, you weren't there.

[Scene: The Launderama. Rachel is there, waiting for Ross. An old
woman takes Rachel's clothes off the machine and begins loading it
with her things.]

WOMAN: Comin' through. Move, move.

RACH: Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.

WOMAN: Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.

RACH: But I saved it. I put my basket on top.

WOMAN: Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty.
Unfortunately, I don't see suds.

RACH: What?

WOMAN: No suds, no save. Ok?

[Ross arrives.]

ROSS: What's goin' on?

RACH: Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.

ROSS: Was your basket on top?

RACH: Yeah, but, there were no suds.

ROSS: So?

RACH: Well, you know, no suds, no save.

ROSS: No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. [to woman] That's my
friend's machine.

WOMAN: Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.

ROSS: Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.

[The woman and Ross stare at each other. Finally she takes her stuff
out of the machine and leaves.]

ROSS: [to the crowd in the laundromat] All right, show's over.
Nothing to see here. [to Rachel] Ok, let's do laundry.

RACH: That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.

ROSS: Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you,
uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.

[Ross pulls out a huge box of laundry detergent.]

RACH: What's that?

ROSS: Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.

[Rachel starts to load her clothes.]

ROSS: Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?

RACH: Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am
I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another
machine for pants?

ROSS: Rach, have you never done this before?

RACH: Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you
caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.

ROSS: Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um,
basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a
whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh,
your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your
under-panty things.

RACH: [holds a pair of panties in front of Ross] Ok, Well, what
about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites
or delicates?

ROSS: [visibly nervous] Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.

[Scene: Fancy restaurant. Monica, Joey, Angela, and Bob are seated
at the table.]

MNCA: [to Joey] He is so cute. [to Angela and Bob] So, where did
you guys grow up?

ANGL: Brooklyn Heights.

BOB: Cleveland.

MNCA: How, how did that happen?

JOEY: Oh my god.

MNCA: What?

JOEY: I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.

 

Commercial Break
[Scene: Fancy restaurant. Joey and Bob are talking.]

JOEY: So, you and Angela, huh?

BOB: Yep. Pretty much.

JOEY: You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her?
That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little
squirrel, or a weasel.

BOB: Huh, I never really noticed.

JOEY: Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.

BOB: Monica, Monica is great.

JOEY: Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed.
Sexually.

[Scene: The ladies' bathroom at the restaurant. Monica and Angela
are talking.]

MNCA: I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.

ANGL: Yeah, isn't he?

MNCA: It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and
has an emotional age beyond, like eight.

ANGL: You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.

MNCA: Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.

ANGL: Huh. That's nice.

[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe is coaching Chandler on how to break up
with Janice.]

PHOE: Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.

Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.

[Chandler walks back to couch, where Janice is.]

CHAN: Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should
go out anymore. Janice.

JNCE: All right. Well, there you go. [she gets extremely wound up,
and begins to try and calm herself down] Stop it, stop it, stop it.

[Scene: The laundromat.]

RACH: Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel
that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own
laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.

ROSS: That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the
first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol
left me? [the buzzer on the washer goes off] I'm sorry, that's
all the time we have. Next on Ross...[opens up the washer]
Uh-oh.

RACH: What uh-oh?

ROSS: [not wanting to tell her] Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done.
It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. [singing]
Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.

RACH: Ross, what's the matter?

ROSS: Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.

RACH: Come on, show me.

ROSS: All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in
with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.

RACH: Oh, everything's pink.

ROSS: Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm
sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.

RACH: Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look
like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing?
My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do
laundry!

[The woman who had tried to steal the washing machine walks by, and
laughs.]

[Scene: The fancy restaurant. Angela has her hand in Bob's shirt,
and Monica is very uncomfortable.]

MNCA: Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his
head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down
Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate
this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we
check it in the light, please?

[Her and Joey walk away from the table.]

MNCA: Oh my god.

JOEY: What?

MNCA: Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails
in Appalachia.

JOEY: Come on, they're close.

MNCA: Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.

JOEY: Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.

MNCA: Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's--not really
true, is it?

JOEY: Well, who's to say what's true? I mean--

MNCA: Oh my god, what were you thinking?

JOEY: All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am
a little.

MNCA: [hits him lightly] Oh!

JOEY: Ow!

MNCA: [leaving] I'm outta here.

JOEY: Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.

MNCA: Really?

JOEY: Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the
two of us, we can break them up.

[Scene changes to later that night. Monica accidentally spilled her
drink on Bob's shirt and is wiping it off. Joey is making eyes at
Angela.]

MNCA: I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't
stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.

[Angela is eating chicken wings and making the weasel-like noise
Joey had told Bob about.]

JOEY: Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.

[Scene: Central Perk. Chandler is still trying to ease things
over with Janice, and there are about a dozen empty Espresso cups in front of him. He is extremely wired.]

CHAN: Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're
different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom,
[Chandler flails his hand out and hits Janice in the eye]... boom.

JNCE: Ow!

CHAN: Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?

JNCE: Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right
back.

[She leaves.]

CHAN: [to Phoebe] I hit her in the eye! I hit her in
the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history
of the world.

PHOE: Oh my god. [Chandler downs another espresso.] How many of those
have you had?

CHAN: Oh, I don't know, a million?

PHOE: Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la
la la la.

CHAN: I'm fine.

PHOE: All right.

[Janice returns from the bathroom.]

CHAN: I'm not fine. Here she comes.

PHOE: Wait here. Breathe.

[Phoebe goes over to speak to Janice. She talks to her for a few
seconds, and then Janice immediately smiles, hugs her, waves to
Chandler, and leaves.]

CHAN: How do you do that?

PHOE: It's like a gift.

CHAN: We should always always break up together.

PHOE: Oh, I'd like that.

[Scene: The Launderama. Rachel is sorting her now-pink clothes.]

ROSS: You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.

RACH: Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.

[The same woman walks over and takes Rachel's laundry cart.]

RACH: Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.

WOMAN: Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come
on, get outta my way.

[Rachel looks at Ross, who motions to her to get the cart back.]

RACH: I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is
our cart.

WOMAN: Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.

RACH: Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!

WOMAN: Let go!

[They struggle for the cart. Finally, Rachel climbs inside of it.]

RACH: All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna
have to take me with it!

[She thinks it over, and then walks away.]

RACH: [to Ross] Yes! Did you see that?

ROSS: You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.

RACH: I could not have done this without you.

[Rachel stands up and kisses Ross. He is stunned. A moment of
silence follows.]

ROSS: Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? [Ross turns and bangs
his head on an open dryer door.] I'm fine, I'm fine.

RACH: Are you sure?

ROSS: No.

[Scene: Central Perk. Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there. Ross has
an icepack to his head.]

RACH: Oh, are you sure you're ok?

ROSS: Yeah.

RACH: Does it still hurt?

ROSS: Yeah.

PHOE: [seeing Rachel's clothes] What a neat idea. All your clothes
match. I'm gonna do this.

[Monica and Joey enter.]

MNCA: Hi.

PHOE: Hey, how'd it go?

JOEY: Excellent.

MNCA: We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.

ROSS: What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.

MNCA: [notices his head] Oh, I'm sorry.

RACH: Where's Chandler?

PHOE: Oh, he needed some time to grieve.

[Chandler runs by the window outside, joyous.]

CHAN: I'm free! I'm free!

PHOE: That oughta do it.
