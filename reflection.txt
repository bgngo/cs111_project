We performed comparison tests for three pairs of text sources. For the first pair, we used Book 1 in the Harry Potter series and random Shakespeare excerpts. We then tested Book 2 Chapter 1 of the Harry Potter series, which our program correctly determined it was from J. K. Rowling. For the second pair, we used an episode from Breaking Bad and an episode from Better Call Saul. We then tested another episode from Better Call Saul, which our program incorrectly concluded that it was from Breaking Bad. For the third pair, we used the first five episodes of Season 1 of Friends and an episode from How I Met Your Mother. We then tested 3 episodes from Friends and the pilot of HIMYM, which our program correctly determined which source they are more likely to come from. Out of three pairs of text sources, our program produced faulty results for one. For the other pairs, our program worked well, especially our additional features. We chose to count the number of exclamation and question marks, which we believe can be significant for some authors. To improve our program, we would target the stem function to make the code look cleaner.
