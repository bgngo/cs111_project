INT. STUDY - EVENING, YEAR 2030
(FUTURE TED)
TED’S CHILDREN SIT ON THE COUCH, LISTENING INTENTLY.
FUTURE TED (V.O.)
Kids, if there's one day of the year
that you want to avoid shopping at all
costs, it's Black Friday. If there’s
another, it’s Super Sale Saturday.
INT. MCLARENS - AFTERNOON (DAY ONE)
(BARNEY, MARSHALL, LILY, ROBIN, TED)
THE GANG, MINUS TED, SITS AT MCLARENS.
MARSHALL
You can all now refer to me as
Marshall Eriksen: Inventor. I’ve come
up with the single greatest idea in
food history. Okay, it’s macaroni--
TED HURRIES TO THE BOOTH.
TED
Guys, you'll never believe this! The
bicycle store on 35th & Clark is
having a huge sale.
BARNEY
Oh, joy! (BEAT) Bikes are for losers,
Ted. Real men grow awesome mustaches.
ROBIN
Barney, you don't have a mustache. Let
alone an awesome one.
BARNEY
If you’d read my blog, you’d know that
real real men have the ability to, but
don't need to prove their manliness by
actually growing one. Like Rambo. And
Rocky. Or the guy in Cliffhanger.
LILY
Sylvester Stallone.
BARNEY
No. That’s not it.
ROBIN
He might be an old man, but I’d go to
town on him. Showgirls style.
BARNEY GIVES ROBIN A “WHAT IN THE HELL” LOOK.
MARSHALL
I'm pretty sure I could grow a fairly
thick and awesome mustache if I tried.
LILY
Oh, honey. (CHUCKLES, BEAT) Even I can
grow a better mustache than you.
ROBIN
Uh, TMI, Lily.
LILY
Don't act like we don't go get our
'staches waxed every other Tuesday.
ROBIN LAUGHS NERVOUSLY. SHE TAKES A DRINK.
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"

BARNEY
'Stache waxing? I've never been less
aroused than I am right now, and I've
seen those nudes of Barbara Walters
that are going around. (SHUTTERS) Ugh.
TED
Guys! Can we get back to my story?
MARSHALL
Yeah, go ahead.
EXT. SIDEWALK - EARLIER THAT DAY
(TED)
TED POWER WALKS DOWN THE SIDEWALK. A SIGN IN A WINDOW.
TED (V.O.)
I was on my daily power walk when--
INT. MCLARENS - PRESENT
(TED, BARNEY)
WHERE WE LEFT THEM. BARNEY SLAMS HIS GLASS ON THE TABLE.
BARNEY
Wait a cottin pickin’ minute! Power
walk? You power walk? What, did you
break a hip, Grandpa Mosby?
TED
For your information, power walking is
recommended as an alternative to
jogging because it significantly
decreases impact on the joints.
BARNEY
(SARCASTICALLY) Okay, Dr. Mosby M.D..

EXT. SIDEWALK - EARLIER THAT DAY
(TED)
TED STARES, SLACK-JAWED IN THE WINDOW OF BUCK’S BIKES.
TED (V.O.)
Anyway. I was pow-- walking past
Buck’s Bikes when I saw a sign in the
window that said for one day only,
Schwinn Tailwinds are half-price!
INT. MCLARENS - PRESENT
(TED, BARNEY, MARSHALL, ROBIN, LILY)
BACK AT THE BAR.
ROBIN
So what?
TED
Do you know how much they’re worth?
It's a top-of-the-line model! It's the
only present I've asked my parents for
since I was nine years old.
BARNEY
That's the only thing you've wanted
since you were nine? A dumb bike?
TED
It's not a bike, it's a Schwinn.
BARNEY
Whatever. The only Schwinns I need are
named Olga and Svetlana.
ROBIN
I don't get it.
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"
4.
BARNEY
Swedish twins. Schwinns. Try to keep
up.
LILY
(RE: BIKE, TO TED) When's the sale?
TED
About that. It's kind of on... Super
Sale Saturday.
MARSHALL AND LILY GASP. HORRIFIED. BARNEY SPITS HIS DRINK.
LILY
That's crazy!
MARSHALL
Are you mad!?
BARNEY
You must be loco, ese!
ROBIN
Wait. What's Super Sale Saturday?
LILY
Black Friday was the new Christmas
Eve. Then Cyber Monday became the new
Black Friday. Now Super Sale Saturday
is the new Cyber Monday.
MARSHALL
Prices are so low, they're practically
subterranean. It's the single most
dangerous shopping day of the year.
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"
5.
(MORE)
(BEAT) Well, except for the day U2
tickets go on sale.
TED
It’s not that bad.
LILY
What about what happened last year?
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - FLASHBACK
(TED)
TED AND A NERDY GUY PLAY TUG-OF-WAR WITH THE LAST STAR WARS
DVD BOX SET. TED PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE. HE TRIUMPHANTLY
RAISES THE DVDS IN THE AIR. HE TURNS AND IS IMMEDIATELY
PUNCHED IN THE FACE BY A NERDY GIRL. SHE SNATCHES THE DVDS.
INT. MCLARENS - WHERE WE LEFT THEM
(TED, MARSHALL, LILY, ROBIN, BARNEY)
BACK AT THE BOOTH.
TED
But it's a Schwinn. And I need someone
to come wait in line with me in case I
have to pee. Marshall? Lily?
MARSHALL & LILY
No.
TED
Come on guys. Robin?
ROBIN
I'm gonna say... no?
TED
Barney?
TED GIVES BARNEY THE PUPPY DOG EYES. CUT BACK AND FORTH
BETWEEN TED'S SAD FACE AND BARNEY TRYING TO RESIST. THERE'S
PAIN IN HIS FACE. HE EVENTUALLY GIVES IN.
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"

MARSHALL (CONT'D)
BARNEY
You know I can’t say no to the puppy
dog eyes! That's cheating!
TED JUMPS UP. HE DOES A CELEBRATORY DANCE.
TED
Yes! (SINGSONGY) I'm getting a Schwiinn! I'm getting a Schwi-inn!
BARNEY
How can anyone say no to such a poor,
sad, pitiful, dejected--
TED
I get it, I'm pathetic. But it's
common knowledge that every Triple S
shopper needs a great wingman.
BARNEY
Hmmm. (THINKING IT OVER) Gabe Walker!
That’s the name of the guy Sylvester
Stallone played in Cliffhanger! Bike
suit up, Ted! Because tomorrow, baby's
coming home with a shiny, new bicycle!
TED
It's not a bike, it's a Schwinn.
BARNEY
Sch-whatever.

ACT TWO
INT. TED’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
(MARSHALL, LILY, ROBIN)
MARSHALL AND ROBIN SIT ON THE COUCH.
MARSHALL
And I’m going to call it Snack...
aroni! Snackaroni! It's the New York
City treat.
ROBIN
And what is it exactly?
MARSHALL
What is it!? I'll tell you what it is.
It's only the tastiest macaroni and
cheese on the planet! And it’ll come
in single serving packs for enjoying
when and where you feel the urge.
ROBIN
And that’s different than Easy Mac,
how?
MARSHALL
You know... It's like... like totally
different. And stuff.
ROBIN
Awesome idea, Marshall Eriksen:
Inventor.
LILY ENTERS FROM THE KITCHEN. MARSHALL, WEARING EXTREMELY
TIGHT PANTS, STANDS. HE BENDS OVER TO PICK UP A MAGAZINE.
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"
8.
LILY
Oh, Marshall. You're not wearing those
pants again, are you?
MARSHALL
What's wrong with these pants? I think
they're very becoming on me.
LILY
Nothing. Other than the fact that
they’re a size 31 and it takes you
over an hour to squeeze into them.
MARSHALL
Just because I’m a 34 doesn’t mean I
can’t wear my sexy pants.
LILY
Seriously, they make your usually
amazing ass look like two honey-baked
hams shoved in a denim garbage bag.
MARSHALL
You know exactly how to hurt me, Lily
Aldrin-Eriksen. (STIFLES HIS TEARS)You
know exactly--
MARSHALL RUNS AWAY. LILY TAKES A SEAT NEXT TO ROBIN.
ROBIN
You tell Marshall what clothes he can
wear? What, is he ten years old?
LILY
My baby got's to look good.
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"
9.
ROBIN
Yeah, well I think baby's lookin' pretty fine in those pantaloons. You got
yourself one hot piece of man meat.
LILY
Robin! What’s gotten into you tonight?
ROBIN
I can’t remember the last time I--
LILY
Took a dump?
ROBIN
Ewww, no. Knocked boots. I really need
to find a guy tonight. I have a
serious case of lady-boner right now.
LILY LOOKS DISGUSTED.
INT. MCLARENS - NIGHT - LATER
(TED, BARNEY)
TED AND BARNEY STAND AT THE BAR, DRINKS IN HAND.
BARNEY
If I’m going to risk life and limb so
you can fulfill some silly childhood
dream of owning a Huffy Sledgehammer,
you have to repay me in kind.
TED
I guess that's fair. As long as it
doesn't involve stealing a platypus
from the zoo.
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"

FREEZE FRAME ON TED.
FUTURE TED (V.O.)
Kids, if there’s one thing you should
never bring to a bar, it’s a platypus.
But I’ll tell you more about that
later.
UNFREEZE. BARNEY PUTS AN ARM AROUND TED’S SHOULDER.
BARNEY
We arrived here tonight as men, but by
the morn, good sir, we will be gods.
TED
We have to be in line at Buck’s Bikes
by 2 AM. Not a millisecond later. It's
eight o'clock now, so that gives
you... (LOOKS AT WATCH) six hours.
A COUNTDOWN APPEARS ON SCREEN. 6:00:00 IT STARTS. 5:59:59.
BARNEY (CONT'D)
Ted, I’m a pro. That’s ample time.
Prepare to make history, because
tonight, we do... The Midnight
Pumpkin.
INT. TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
(LILY, ROBIN, MARSHALL)
LILY AND ROBIN STAND OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM DOOR. MARSHALL HAS
LOCKED HIMSELF INSIDE.
LILY
Marshall, will you just come out of
the bathroom already!?
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"
11.
MARSHALL (O.S.)
This booty is one-of-a-kind! It does
NOT look like a Thanksgiving turkey.
LILY
I said Christmas ham.
MARSHALL (O.S.)
Oh, like that's any better!
ROBIN
Actually, you said honey-baked ham.
MARSHALL (O.S.)
How heartless can you be?
ROBIN
If it's any consolation, I think
you're rockin' the hell out of those
jeans. I mean... (BITES LIP) Mmm.
MARSHALL (O.S.)
You hear that, Lily! I'm rockin' 'em!
LILY
I’m sorry I said your buns look like
hams. Just come out.
MARSHALL (O.S.)
Not until you admit that it’s just as
supple and juicy... and delicious...
ROBIN
Are you talking about your ass or the
ham?
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"
12.
MARSHALL
My derriere, thank you very much.
ROBIN POKES LILY, URGING HER.
ROBIN
(TO LILY) If you don’t end this soon,
I can’t be held responsible if I break
down that door and have my way with
your husband. Mama needs it bad.
LILY
I admit it!
MARSHALL WHIPS OPEN THE DOOR. HE TAKES A HEROIC STANCE.

(TED, BARNEY)
TED AND BARNEY AT THE BAR WHERE WE LEFT THEM.
TED
Midnight Pumpkin?
BARNEY
I originally called it The Pinocchio,
but due to copyright infringement,
Disney made me change it.
TED
(SKEPTICAL) Disney?
BARNEY
Dude. My blog. READ IT!
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"
13.
TED
So you're going to pretend you've been
carved out of wood?
BARNEY
Don't be silly, Ted. There's only one
part of my body that's wood. What up!
BARNEY RAISES HIS HAND FOR A HIGH FIVE. TED SHAKES HIS HEAD.
BARNEY (CONT'D)
Okay, so here's the deal. We acquire a
gullible girl. You tell her that you
are a woodcarver from a small Italian
village and that you carved me out of
a piece of magical wood. I’ve come to
life, but at the stroke of midnight,
I’m going to turn back into a block of
wood, unless... Well, you know.
TED
This is what's going to make us gods?
BARNEY
This is one of the hardest plays to
pull off. That's why I need YOU. You
play a crucial roll in this one.
You're Geppetto.
TED
You do know that Pinnocchio turned
into a real boy, not a block of wood.

Cinderella's carriage turned into the
pumpkin at midnight.

comfy pa-ants/Feelin' so good, on muh
bod-ay.
LILY
Really, Marshall? Really?
MARSHALL
Come on, babe. I know I look good in
my special pants. You can’t tell me
you don't want to hit this.
LILY
Oh, I want to hit you all right.
ROBIN, LOOKING DISHEVELLED, COMES TO THEM AT THE BAR.
ROBIN
If I don’t find a guy soon, I’m going
to explode! I will literally take
anything I can get.

LILY
Anything?
ROBIN
Anything.
MARSHALL
How about that guy over there?
THEY ALL LOOK AT AN OVERWEIGHT, UNIBROWED GUY.
ROBIN
Well, not anything. I just don’t know
what’s wrong with me lately. I’ve been
in the worst slump of my adult career.
LILY
Come on, it can’t be that bad.
ROBIN
Oh, really?
INT. BAR - EARLIER
(ROBIN, GUY)
ROBIN TAPS A RANDOM GUY ON THE SHOULDER. HE TURNS.
ROBIN
Okay, I’ve struck out with every guy
in this place, so here’s a one time
offer. How about you BEEP my BEEP then
BEEP BEEP me in the BEEP. Take your
BEEP and BEEP until you can’t BEEP
anymore.

smuggling a hotdog and bun down the
front of your pants.
BARNEY
Lily, we have more important things to
worry about than food storage. We need
a gullible looking girl, pronto.
MARSHALL POINTS TO A GIRL WITH A BEER BELLY.

What do you think about her, Barney?
BARNEY
Yeah right. She’s got a “booty-doo”.
LILY
A what?

BARNEY
“Booty-doo”, where the stomach sticks
out more than the booty do.
TED POINTS TO A SMALL-CHESTED GIRL WITH BUMPED HAIR.
TED
What about Snookie Jr.?
BARNEY
You’ve got to be kidding.
MARSHALL
What's wrong with her?
BARNEY
Only this whole region. (SQUEEZES HIS
IMAGINARY BOOBS) She’s all nips. It
looks like two aspirin on an ironing
board. Like I dropped two peanut M&Ms
on my kitchen floor.
LILY
You’re disgusting, Barney.
BARNEY
Come on, guys! Get your heads in the
game! Ted, you’d think you know your
best friend better than that by now.

ROBIN STANDS WITH A VERY COCKY LOOKING MUSTACHED MAN. HE
TALKS TO ROBIN, BUT IS MORE FOCUSED ON HIS PHONE.
ROBIN
Hey there, cowboy. What's your name?
LIMAHL
You don't recognize me? I'm only the
face of one of the most popular bands
of all time. That's right, Limahl in

little boys room to make tinkle. Don't
you run off, beautiful.
LIMAHL TAPS ROBIN ON THE NOSE, SHE NEARLY MELTS. HE EXITS.
SHE RUNS BACK TO THE GROUP.

lead singer and synthesist... er...
ist... He plays keyboard for
Kajagoogoo. And he’s into extreme
sports. I am so good to go right now.

What the hell is “Kafloogl-loo”?

greatest song ever! The Neverending
Story theme song!

on the planet for that.

He sounds like a real douche to me.

Shut up, Ted. (TO ROBIN) Go get
yourself some, Miss Thang.

Oh, yeah, I shaved off my mustache.
ROBIN
Why would you get rid of such a sweet
flavor saver? You were rockin' the
hell out of that 'stache.
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"

LIMAHL
The blog I read says that real real
men gain their power from knowing they
have the ability to grow a mustache,
but not actually growing one.

Golly gee willickers, Papa. I don't
want to turn back into a piece of wood
at midnight. I want to be a real boy!
GIRL
Oh my gosh... You're going to turn
back into wood?
BARNEY
The only way to stop the process is to
have sex with me before the “stroke”
of midnight.
GIRL
Ugh! I don't think so. You're only 6!
SHE THROWS HER DRINK IN HIS FACE THEN WALKS AWAY.
BARNEY
So close. So-o close. I don't know why
this isn't working.
TED
You mean, besides the fact that you're
trying to convince girls that you're a
wooden puppet and I'm your Italian
woodcarving father?
BARNEY
Okay, I admit, The Midnight Pumpkin
isn't the greatest. That's why you
should always have a Plan P.

Come on, Barney. I don't want to do
this anymore. It’s getting late. We’re
going to have to leave soon.
BARNEY
Ted, you can’t honestly expect me to
stand in line for six straight hours
without first getting my freak on, can
you? Plus, you made a promise. And if
you go back on a promise, then what
faith can you have in this crazy,
mixed-up world? Promises are the only
thing that separate us from animals.
TED
And here I thought it was opposable
thumbs.
BARNEY
Nope. It’s promises.
TED
Okay, what's Plan B?
BARNEY
Not “B”, Ted. Plan “P”! It's simple,
really. Plan P is the platypus plan.
TED
Are you just saying that to piss me
off? I said, no platypi.
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"

BARNEY
Au contraire, you said no stealing of
platypi. I don't need to burgle a
platypus. I have a guy.

Thank you. Let me ask you something,
pseudo-Limahl. What is the greatest
culinary innovation of all time?
LIMAHL
Uh, the fork?
MARSHALL
No, it's macaroni and cheese that
comes in single serving packets. It’s
a million dollar idea. And I’m going
to call it Snackaroni! Does that not
blow your mind?

He went into the bathroom ‘stached-up

Triangle for mustaches. One mustache
goes in. No mustaches come out.

limit has already been met. I'm at
maximum “bropacity”.

Hey, Barney, some guy said to give
this to you. I think there's something
alive in there.

Honey. I love you, but you look like a
thirteen year old girl in those pants.
I’m telling you for your own good.
MARSHALL
Okay, I’ll take them off, but under
one condition... You know what.
MARSHALL RAISES HIS EYEBROWS.
INT. BAR - NIGHT - LATER
(BARNEY, TED, WANDA)
TED AND BARNEY STAND AT THE BAR. TED IS HOLDING THE PET
CARRIER. THEY APPROACH A GIRL. CLOCK: 00:59:37.
WANDA
What's in the cage?
BARNEY
Ted, the puss!
TED RAISES THE PET CARRIER.
BARNEY (CONT’D)
This here's a platypus. One of
nature’s most amazing and ridiculous
looking creatures. What’s say you come
back to my place and get a closer look
at my platypus?
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"
32.
WANDA
Do you have a license for that thing?
BARNEY
The only license I need is a license
to love.
WANDA
(SEDUCTIVELY) Oh, you don't need a
license for that. (BEAT) But
unfortunately for you, I'm a police
officer and in the state of New York,
you do need a permit for your
platypus.
SHE FLASHES HER BADGE.
TED
No.
WANDA
I'm afraid you're under arrest.
SHE CUFFS HIM.
BARNEY
It’s just a fish-rodent!
TED
Actually, it’s a semiaquatic, egglaying mammal.
WANDA
You too, Science boy. Put your hands
behind your back. Lack of a platypus
permit, that's a class 2 misdemeanor.
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"
33.
TED
It’s not my platypus, I swear! I’m
holding it for a friend.
SHE CUFFS TED.
INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT - LATER
(BARNEY, TED, CELLMATE, JAILER)
BARNEY AND TED SIT IN JAIL. THE CLOCK FLASHES 0:00:00.
BARNEY
Who would've known you needed a permit
for a platypus?
TED
Me! I knew! I told you! And thanks to
you, I’m not going to get my Schwinn.
I hope your platypus was worth it.
BARNEY
Chillax, Bro Piscapo. Little “Parney”
was definitely worth it.
TED
You ruin everything, you know that?
BARNEY
I said I was sorry. Isn't that enough?
CELLMATE
What’re you two arguing about?
TED
He cost me a Schwinn Tailwind.
CELLMATE
You're that mad over a dumb bike?
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"
34.
TED & BARNEY
It's not a bike, it's a Schwinn.
CELLMATE
Whatever.
THE JAILER OPENS THE JAIL CELL DOOR.
JAILER
Okay, you're free to go.
INT. POLICE STATION LOBBY - NIGHT - LATER
(TED, BARNEY, ROBIN)
ROBIN STANDS IN THE LOBBY. TED AND BARNEY ENTER.
ROBIN
Hey there, criminals, need a ride?
TED
I do. But he'll be taking a taxi.
BARNEY
Come on, Ted, I said I was sorry. What
else do you want from me?
TED
I want my Schwinn. Goodnight, Barney.
BARNEY
But, Ted I--
TED
I said goodnight.
INT. TED'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON (DAY 2)
(TED, MARSHALL, MAILMAN)
MARSHALL
So what do you think?
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"
35.
TED
It sounds like you just invented Easy
Mac.
MARSHALL
You, of all people, Ted. I thought
you'd be on my side.
TED
What side? Are we choosing sides?
MARSHALL
You know what side!
MARSHALL HUFFS AND PUFFS THEN EXITS ANGRILY.
SFX: DOORBELL
TED OPENS THE DOOR. MAILMAN. HE HAS A HUGE BOX.
MAILMAN
Delivery for Theodore Evelynn Mosby.
TED
I didn't order anything.
MAILMAN
I guess I must have the wrong Theodore
Evelynn Mosby. Just sign for it, dude.
I have Maroon 5 tickets.
TED SIGNS. HE CLOSES THE DOOR. HE OPENS THE BOX. IT'S A BIKE.
INT. BAR - AFTERNOON (DAY THREE)
(TED, BARNEY, MARSHALL, ROBIN, LILY)
TED, LILY AND ROBIN SIT AT THE BOOTH.
LILY
Robin, you seem different.
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"
36.
ROBIN
Maybe it’s because I had an amazing
two and half minutes in a bathroom
stall with the lead singer of a
Kajagoogoo tribute band Friday night.
MARSHALL, WEARING A RIDICULOUS PONCHO, SETS 4 BEERS ON THE
TABLE AND TAKES A SEAT.
LILY
Marshall, I take it back. I’d rather
have you wear the tight pants. You
look like a Mexican drifter.
MARSHALL
You have to come to terms with your
jealousy. That's what Dr. Phil says.
LILY
Well, Dr. Lily says, men who wear
stupid ponchos don't get sex. Are you
ready to come to terms with that?
MARSHALL
Poncho gone.
MARSHALL QUICKLY REMOVES THE PONCHO AND TOSSES IT OVER HIS
HEAD. BARNEY ENTERS.
TED
Barney, did you buy me a bike?
BARNEY
No Ted, I bought you a Schwinn.
TED
Whatever. How did you afford it?
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"
37.
BARNEY
Cyber Monday, dude. Why would I wait
in line when I could buy on line?
TED
I can't believe this.
BARNEY
I know. Cyber Monday deals are way
better than those stupid Super Sale
Saturday sales, sucka.
MARSHALL GOLF CLAPS.
MARSHALL
Great alliteration.
TED
It's been over twenty years, and I
finally have it. This is the greatest
day of my life. Well, except for the
day I got those U2 tickets.
LILY
What are you waiting for? Try that beeotch out!
ROBIN
Ride that thing like it's your
birthday!
TED
You're right. I need to do this. I'm
gonna ride!
TED GRABS THE BIKE AND RUNS OUT.
HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER - "THE MIDNIGHT PUMPKIN"

EXT. CITY STREET - AFTERNOON
(TED, SHADY GUY)
TED RIDES HIS SCHWINN DOWN THE STREET. HAPPY MUSIC.
FUTURE TED (V.O.)
And that's how I got my first Schwinn.
SHADY GUY
HEY! Hey, guy!
TED COMES TO A STOP NEXT TO THE SHADY GUY.
TED
And what can I do for you this fine
day, sir?
THE SHADY GUY PULLS A GUN. HE POINTS IT AT TED.
TED (CONT’D)
Wait... Are you stealing my bike?
SHADY GUY
No. I'm stealing your Schwinn. It’s a
Tailwind. Do you know how much this
thing is worth?
TED GIVES HIM THE BIKE. THE SHADY GUY RIDES AWAY.
SHADY GUY (CONT’D)
(SINGSONGY) I got a Schwi-inn! I got a
Schwi-inn!
FUTURE TED (V.O.)
And that's how I lost my first
Schwinn.

MARSHALL

FALKOR
What is it, Marshall?
MARSHALL
Can you call me Bastian?
FALKOR
All right, hold on tight, Bastian!
Whaaaa!
MARSHALL
Yeah!
MARSHALL THROWS AN ARM IN THE AIR AS THEY FLY THROUGH THE
CLOUDS AND OVER MOUNTAINS.
MARSHALL (CONT’D)
Wow! Wow-wee!
