Okay. You guys are old enough. I’m *

your mother. *
DAUGHTER *

Heard it. *
*
SON *
You told us already. *

NARRATOR (O.S.) *
Sure, you’ve heard the short version.
But there’s a bigger story, and it’s *
important for you to hear it. *

No. *

MARSHALL, HIS BOYISH, MIDWESTERN BEST FRIEND. *
NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D) *
It was way back in 2005. I was single, *
I had a full head of hair, my career *
as an architect was taking off, and I *
lived in New York City with Marshall, *
my best friend from college. Life was *
good, until one brisk October night, *
when Uncle Marshall screwed the whole *
thing up. *

PRESENTS TED WITH A DIAMOND RING. *
MARSHALL *
Will you marry me? *
TED *
Perfect! And then she says yes, you’re *
engaged, you pop the champagne, drink *
a toast, have sex on the kitchen *
floor. (BEAT, THINKS) Don’t have sex *
on our kitchen floor. *
MARSHALL *
Got it. Geez, I’m so nervous. My *
stomach’s going crazy. *

TED *
You were about to. *

It could be cancer! I’ve got all these *
symptoms, I’ve been peeing like crazy, *
my mouth is dry, she’s gonna say no! *
TED *
All right, c’mere, bring it in. *
TED GIVES HIM A HUG. *
MARSHALL *
Thanks for helping me plan this out, *
Ted. *
TED *
Dude, it’s you and Lily! I’ve been *
there for all the big moments of you *
and Lily. The night you met, your *
first date...other first things. *
MARSHALL *
I’m sorry. We thought you were asleep. *

It’s physics, Marshall. If the bottom *
bunk moves, the top bunk moves too. *

BARNEY *
Trust me. They’re Leba-licious. *
TED *
Listen, Marshall’s getting engaged *
here tonight. You wanna-- *
BARNEY *
(SNAPPING INTO ACTION) Meet me at the *

Superman, you’re Clark Kent. *

Wait, doesn’t Clark Kent always wear a *
suit? And doesn’t Superman kinda wear *
pajamas? *
BARNEY *
(IN A FEMALE VOICE) “Ooh, Michelle,
check out those two guys over at the
bar arguing about Superman. God, that
gets me hot!” (AS HIMSELF) Come on,
Ted. Pull yourself together.
TED *
You know what’s weird? I just spent *
all day planning this romantic *
marriage proposal...and it’s for *
someone else. *
BARNEY *
Oh, I see. Marshall gets engaged, and *
all of a sudden your ovaries are *
shrinking. Have you forgotten what I *
said to you the night we met? We were *
sitting right over there... *
WE STYLISHLY WHIP-PAN TO A BOOTH WHERE, MAGICALLY, A YOUNGER *

TED *
Oh, right. Hi. *
BARNEY *
Lesson one, lose the goatee. Lesson *
two, never wear jeans to a strip club. *
You want a fabric that’s light and *
roomy. *
TED *
Why? (BEAT, REALIZING) Oh. *
BARNEY *
Lesson three: don’t even think about *
getting married till you’re 30. *
WHIP-PAN BACK TO PRESENT-DAY BARNEY AND TED AT THE BAR. *
TED *
I’m not thinking about it. Just ‘cuz *
my best friend’s getting married *
doesn’t mean I have to. *
BARNEY *
I thought I’m your best friend. (BEAT) *
Ted, say I’m your best friend. *
TED *
You’re my best friend, Barney. *

BARNEY *
Good. Then as your best friend, I *
suggest we play a little game I call, *
“Have Ya Met Ted?” *
TED *
What? No, we’re not playing “Have Ya *
Met Ted.” *
TOO LATE. BARNEY TAPS AN EXOTIC, SEXY GIRL ON THE SHOULDER. *

THE TABLE’S SET, AND COOKING IS UNDERWAY. MARSHALL’S TRYING *
TO LIGHT MANY CANDLES WITH ONE DWINDLING MATCH. *

MARSHALL
Ow! Ow ow ow ow ow ow! *
THE FRONT DOOR OPENS. LILY (EARTHY, STRONG, MATERNAL) ENTERS.
LILY
I’ve had a long day, my eyes could be *
playing tricks on me - but it almost *
looks like you’re cooking. *
MARSHALL *
I am. You’ve been taking care of hyper- *
active kindergartners all day. So now *
I’m taking care of you. *
LILY *
Oh, you’re the best. It was finger- *
painting day. *
SHE OPENS HER COAT TO REVEAL A NICE BLOUSE COVERED IN FINGER- *
PAINT. THERE IS A CLEAR HANDPRINT ON HER BREAST. *
MARSHALL *
Did someone touch your boob? *
LILY *
Justin Stangel. He’s a very advanced *
little boy. (THEN) I could really use *
a shower. *
MARSHALL
You go ahead. I’ll propose the feast *
(CATCHING HIMSELF) prepare the feast. *
LILY HEADS FOR THE BATHROOM. MARSHALL LOOKS AT A RECIPE.
10.
MARSHALL (CONT’D)
Hey, sweetie? If the recipe says
cinnamon and we don’t have cinnamon,
can I use nutmeg?
LILY
Sure, I guess.
MARSHALL
Sweetie, where’s the nutmeg?
LILY
On the spice-rack. *
LILY ALMOST MAKES IT TO THE BATHROOM THIS TIME, BUT THEN...
MARSHALL
Where’s the spice-rack? *
LILY
Over the oven!
MARSHALL
Oh, here it is. Oh, hey, we do have
cinnamon! (BEAT) Wait, it’s cinnamon
sticks. Can you eat these? (WITH A *
MOUTHFUL) Oh, no, no you cannot. *
Sweetie?!
LILY PUTS HER HEAD IN HER HANDS.
INT. BAR - NIGHT
(TED, YASMIN) *
TED SITS AT A TABLE, FLIRTING WITH YASMIN. *

11.
TED
Here’s how it breaks down: I’m 27 now. *
I’ll make partner at my architecture *
firm by 30, so that’s when I’ll start *
looking. It’ll take two years to meet
her, that’s 32. We date for a year, *
and at 33, I propose. Then you need a
year to book a room and a decent band. *
That puts me married at 34. So, yeah, *
marriage is the furthest thing from my *
mind right now. *
YASMIN *
Really? Because it’s all you’ve talked *
about for the past ten minutes. *
TED *
That’s not true. I also mentioned I’m *
a successful architect. You caught *
that, right? *
YASMIN *
(LAUGHS) Yes. But I don’t think you *
can design your life like it’s some *
building. What if you meet a girl who *
wants to start a family right away? *
You haven’t planned when you’re going *
to have kids, have you? *

12.
TED *
One when I’m 36, one when I’m 39. Two *
boys. *

LILY SHOOTS HIM A LOOK.
MARSHALL (CONT’D)
Ooh! Almost forgot!
HE OPENS THE FRIDGE, GRABS A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE.
LILY *
Oh, honey, champagne! *
A BEAT. MARSHALL HOLDS OUT THE BOTTLE, EXPECTANTLY. *
LILY (CONT’D) *
No. Uh-uh. I’m standing here, cooking
your romantic dinner for me, no,
you’re opening that bottle yourself.
A BEAT. HE GIVES HER THE PUPPY DOG EYES.
13.
LILY (CONT’D)
Marshall, you’re too old to be scared
to open a champagne bottle.
MARSHALL
I’m not scared.
LILY
Then open it!
MARSHALL
Fine. (A BEAT) Please open it. *
LILY
Dammit, Marshall!
THEY CONTINUE ARGUING.

WE GO TO A SPLIT SCREEN. AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, MARSHALL
AND LILY CONTINUE ARGUING. AT THE BOTTOM, TED KEEPS ON
FLIRTING WITH YASMIN.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
In life, there are two big, gutsy *
questions a man has to ask. One’s
usually sweet and romantic, and the *
other usually comes half-drunk in some
bar. But they’re equally important. *
MARSHALL WHIPS OUT THE RING.

Will you marry me?

LILY SITS UP AS WELL, GRINNING.
LILY
Champagne?
MARSHALL *
Allow me, Mademoiselle. *
HE GETS UP, AND PICKS UP THE BOTTLE.

MARSHALL (CONT’D) *
I don’t know why I was so scared of
this. It’s really pretty easy, right?

TED AND BARNEY SIT AT THE BAR DRINKING.
BARNEY
What are you thinking, hitting on the *
bartender’s girlfriend?! *
TED
I bet Marshall and Lily’ll start *
having kids soon. *
BARNEY *
Oh God, we’re back on this... *
TED *
I always figured our kids would play *
together. But now Marshall’s pulling *
ahead. My kids’ll be playing Candyland *
while Marshall junior’s out on the *
porch sneaking cigarettes. *
BARNEY
Okay, lesson number -- God, what are *
we up to? 749 or 750. We’ll round up. *
16.
BARNEY(CONT'D)
Lesson 750: Shut up! You’re too young *
to get married! *
TED *
Six days older than Marshall. *
BARNEY *
Marshall’s from Minnesota. 27-yearolds in Minnesota have grandkids. In
New York, there’s a bar on every
corner. In New York, you’re too young.
TED
You’re right. And there’s one other *
big difference between me and *
Marshall: he’s found the love of his *
life. Even if I was ready, it’s like, *
okay, I’m ready! Where is she? *
HE PRETENDS TO LOOK AROUND...BUT THEN ACTUALLY SEES SOMETHING *
THAT STOPS HIM COLD. *
NARRATOR (V.O.)
And there she was.
WE SEE WHO HE’S LOOKING AT: STANDING BETWEEN TWO OF HER
FRIENDS, ROBIN SCHERBATSKY LOOKS BACK AT TED.

TED LOOKS AT ROBIN (28, BEAUTIFUL, SOPHISTICATED). THEY MAKE *
EYE CONTACT.
NARRATOR (V.O.) *
It was like something from an old
movie, where the sailor sees the girl
across the crowded dance floor, and he
turns to his buddy and says, “See that
girl? I’m gonna marry her someday.”
TED
Hey Barney, see that girl?
BARNEY *
Oh yeah, check out that rack! That is *
some Grade-A sweater meat. (LOOKING *
CLOSER) Wait, dude, that girl’s a *
reporter. I’ve seen her on New York *
One. Go say hi. *
TED *
I can’t just go say hi. No, here’s the *
plan: I’ll wait till she goes to the *
bathroom, then strategically place *
myself at the jukebox so that-- *
BEHIND TED, ROBIN PASSES BY. BARNEY TAPS HER SHOULDER. *

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you hit her? *
MARSHALL AND LILY LOOK AT EACH OTHER. A BEAT. THEY CRACK UP. *
LILY *
Please, I’d kick his skinny ass in. *
MARSHALL *
It’s true, she would. *
LILY *
I mean, I love him, we just got *
engaged, but this guy can barely even *
spank me in bed for fun. It’s just *
these tentative little love-pats-- *

Honey? (RE: CAB DRIVER) Stranger. *

Hey, S&M’s not sick. It’s just good, *

one of those for your fiancee. *

Fiancee! Sweetie, that’s the first *
time someone’s said that! *
MARSHALL
(UNCOMFORTABLE) Yeah...
INT. BAR - NIGHT *
TED AND ROBIN CONTINUE CHATTING AT THE BAR. *
ROBIN *
I’m still new, so they never let me
cover the big stories. I always get
the stupid fluff pieces at the end of *
the news, you know, the monkey who can *
play the ukulele.
TED
A monkey can play the ukulele? That’s *
a big story! First they figure out the *
ukulele, then our computers, our
weaponry. 
20.
TED(CONT'D)
Pretty soon the Statue of Liberty’s
half buried on some beach, and people
are saying, “Why didn’t we see this *
coming?!” Why? Because you didn’t *
watch the stupid fluff piece at the *
end of the news. *
ROBIN LAUGHS. OVER AT HER TABLE, HER FRIENDS GLARE AT THEM. *
TED (CONT’D) *
Your friends don’t seem too happy. *
ROBIN
That’s ‘cuz I’m here talking to a
Daniel.
TED
Actually it’s Ted. Have ya met Ted?
ROBIN
No, see, the one in the middle just *
got dumped by this jerk, Daniel. And *
so tonight, every guy is a Daniel. *
TED *
You know, if it’ll make your friend *
feel better, you could throw a drink *
in my face. I don’t mind. *
ROBIN *
That’s an oddly sweet offer. I might *
just take you up on that. Anything I *
can do in return? *

21.
TED *
Have dinner with me Saturday night. *
ROBIN *
Ooh, I can’t, we’re all going to *
Bermuda for a week. We leave Friday. *
ROBIN’S DUMPED FRIEND CALLS OUT. *
DUMPED FRIEND *
Hey, what’s taking so long?! *

Well, I know it’s a long-shot, but *

ROBIN (CONT’D) *
(LOUD) Jerk! (SOTTO) See you tomorrow. *

NARRATOR (V.O.) *
So the next night, I took her out to *
dinner at this cute little bistro, *
where we sat under a blue French horn. *
ROBIN *
That is a bad-ass blue French horn. I *
gotta get something like that to hang *
over my fireplace. *
TED *
You know, I came here once with my *
friend Barney and he said something *
about that blue French horn, and as a *
result, I couldn’t enjoy my meal. *
ROBIN *
What did he say? *
TED *
He said it’s probably what a Smurf *
penis would look like. *

NARRATOR (V.O.) *
Son, a piece of advice. When you go on *
a first date with a girl, you don’t *
want to say “Smurf penis.” Girls don’t *
ordinarily like that. *

‘em, right? Very few undecideds out *

observed: in every great relationship, *
there’s an olive lover and an olive *
hater. It’s like positive and negative *
ions. Perfect symbiosis. *

I didn’t chicken out! Kissing a girl *
for the first time is a delicate *
thing. I didn’t even get the signal. *
LILY *
There’s a signal? *
TED *
Yeah, it’s like this exciting *
radiation she gives off. And if you *
don’t feel it, you don’t kiss her. You *
wouldn’t understand. You haven’t been *
single since The Macarena. *
LILY *
Ted, even the dumbest single person *
alive would say you should have kissed *
her. (BEAT) And if you don’t believe *
me, call him. *
INT. LASER TAG ARENA - NIGHT *
(BARNEY, TED) *
31.
BARNEY, IN A LASER TAG VEST AND HELMET, IS IN THE MIDST OF A *
LASER TAG BATTLE. HE STOPS TO ANSWER HIS PHONE. SPLIT-SCREEN *
BETWEEN BARNEY AND TED ON THE PHONE. *
BARNEY *
Hey, loser. How’s not playing Laser *
Tag? Because playing Laser Tag is *
awesome. *
TED *
Listen, I need your opinion-- *
BARNEY *
Meet me at the bar in fifteen! And *
suit up! *
BARNEY HANGS UP ON TED. *
INT. BAR - NIGHT *
MARSHALL, LILY (STILL WEARING EYEPATCH), BARNEY (NOW IN A *
SUIT) AND TED (NOT IN A SUIT) LISTEN TO THE END OF THE STORY. *
TED *
So...what do you think? *
BARNEY *
I can’t believe you’re still not *
wearing a suit! *
TED *
Will you please tell Long Jane Silver *
here I didn’t chicken out? *
BARNEY *
Lily...he totally chickened out. *

32.
TED *
No! Dude, you’re not listening, I *
didn’t get the signal. *
BARNEY *
Oh please. “The signal.” Like that’s *
even a thing. What, is she gonna bat *
her eyes in Morse code? (BLINKING) *
“Ted...I like you...kiss me...” No! *
You just kiss her! *
TED *
You can’t kiss her if you don’t get *
the signal! *
BARNEY GRABS MARSHALL BY THE ARMS AND KISSES HIM ON THE LIPS. *
MARSHALL *
Dude! *
BARNEY *
Did Marshall give me “the signal?” *
MARSHALL *
(SPITTING) No. And you need to shave. *
BARNEY *
But see, at least I’ll get to sleep *
tonight knowing, Marshall and me? *
Never gonna happen. You should’ve *
kissed her. *
BEAT AS TED LETS ALL THIS SINK IN. *

33.
TED *
I should’ve kissed her. Well, I guess *
I’ll just...see her when she gets back *
from Bermuda. *
BARNEY *
Bermuda? Yeah, she’s gonna hook up in *
Bermuda. You’re never gonna see her *
again. So I suggest we play a little *
game I call-- *
MARSHALL *
Hey look, she’s on TV! *
LILY
Ooh, she’s cute! Cheryl, turn it up. *
THE BARTENDER TURNS UP THE VOLUME. ANGLE ON TV: ROBIN, NOW *
MADE UP AND IN A DIFFERENT OUTFIT, REPORTS WITH THE MANHATTAN *
BRIDGE IN THE BACKGROUND. *
ROBIN *
...at which point, police apprehended *
the man, giving this bizarre story a *
happy ending. For New York One News, *
I’m-- *
CHERYL MUTES THE TV. *
MARSHALL *
Huh. The guy didn’t jump. *
SOMEHOW HAUNTED BY THIS, TED STANDS UP. *
TED *
I’m gonna go kiss her goodnight. Right *
now.

34.
BARNEY *
Okay, let’s not do anything crazy. *
TED *
I never do anything crazy! I’m always *
waiting for the moment, planning the *
moment - maybe this is the moment. *
(POINTS TO TV) I gotta do what that *
guy couldn’t. I gotta take the leap. *
(OFF THEIR LOOKS) Okay, it’s not a *
perfect metaphor, ‘cuz for me, it’s *
“fall in love and get married,” and *
for him it’s death. *
BARNEY *
Actually, that is a perfect metaphor. *
(OFF MARSHALL AND LILY’S GLARES) By *
the way, did I congratulate you two? *
TED
So, what do you think?
LILY *
Do it. *
MARSHALL *
Do it. *
ALL EYES TURN TO BARNEY. *
BARNEY *
All right, I’ll sign off on this, but *
under one condition... *

35.
INT. CAB - NIGHT *
THE FOUR OF THEM ARE IN A CAB. TED’S NOW WEARING A SUIT. *
BARNEY *
Look at you in that suit! This totally *
makes up for laser tag! *
TED *
(SEEING SOMETHING) Stop the car! *
THE CAB STOPS, AND TED RUNS OUT. *
MARSHALL *
Where’s he going? *
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT *
THE SAME RESTAURANT FROM THE DATE. A FEW STRAGGLING DINERS *
FINISH THEIR DESSERT. TWO WAITERS TALK. *
WAITER #1 *
So’d that guy end up jumping? *
WAITER #2 *
(DISAPPOINTED) Nah, they never jump. *
TED RUNS IN, GRABS THE FRENCH HORN OFF THE WALL AND RUNS OUT. *
WAITER #1 *
Hey! *
INT. CAB - MOMENTS LATER *
TED DIVES BACK INTO THE CAB WITH THE HORN. *
TED *
Go! Go! Go! (OFF THEIR LOOKS) Flowers *
are so cliche. *
AS THE WAITERS RUN OUT, THE CAB PULLS OFF INTO THE NIGHT. *
END OF ACT TWO *
36.
ACT THREE *
INT. CAB - NIGHT
(NARRATOR, LILY, BARNEY, TED) *
THE CAB PULLS UP IN FRONT OF ROBIN’S BROWNSTONE. TED IS IN
THE FRONT SEAT HOLDING THE FRENCH HORN. BARNEY, MARSHALL, AND
LILY RIDE IN THE BACK.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
So we pulled up in front of her place *
with a stolen blue french horn. *
LILY
...because I love olives and Marshall
hates them. And that’s how Ted came up
with the olive theory. (POKING TED)
Such a romantic.
BARNEY
Yeah. Hey, Ted, if you kiss her, can I
watch? I love it when chicks make out.
TED
Her light’s on. She’s home.
TED GETS OUT OF THE CAB.
LILY
Ted, hang on! So should we wait here? *
What if you, uh... *
BARNEY
Get it on with the TV reporter? *
(CHUCKLING) “This just in.” *
BARNEY LAUGHS AT HIS OWN JOKE. NO ONE ELSE DOES. *

37.
LILY *
(OFF BARNEY, TO TED) Please don’t *
leave us out here all night. *
TED
If it’s going well, I’ll call your *
cellphone and let it ring once. And *
you guys can take off. *
LILY
Kiss her, Ted. Kiss her good.
TED *
Marshall, remember this night. When *
you’re the best man at our wedding, *
and you give a speech...you’re gonna *
tell this story. *
TED WALKS OFF TRIUMPHANTLY. *
BARNEY
Why does he get to be the best man?! *
I’m your best friend! *
EXT. ROBIN’S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
HE APPROACHES HER DOOR.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
With each step, a million thoughts
raced through my mind. Unfortunately,
there was one distinct thought that
didn’t.
FLASH TO:
38.
INT. RESTAURANT - EARLIER THAT NIGHT
(ROBIN)
A SNIPPET FROM TED AND ROBIN’S DINNER CONVERSATION.
ROBIN
I have five dogs.
FLASH TO:
EXT. ROBIN’S BROWNSTONE - WHERE WE LEFT OFF
(TED, BARNEY, ROBIN)
TED RINGS THE DOORBELL. IMMEDIATELY, FIVE DOGS BEGIN BARKING
UPROARIOUSLY. TED FREAKS OUT. LIGHTS START GOING ON IN OTHER
APARTMENTS. TED HEADS BACK TOWARD THE CAB.
TED
Crap. Crap crap crap.
BARNEY LEANS OUT THE WINDOW OF THE CAB
BARNEY
No! Be a man! You’re wearing a suit!
NODDING, TED RETURNS TO ROBIN’S DOOR. THE DOOR OPENS,
REVEALING ROBIN IN HER PAJAMAS.
TED
Hi. I was just, uh... *
HE HOLDS UP THE FRENCH HORN. SHE LOOKS AT IT, AND LOOKS AT
HIM. WITHOUT BATTING AN EYE:
ROBIN
Come on in.
TED GOES INSIDE.
INT. CAB - NIGHT
(BARNEY, RANJIT, LILY, MARSHALL) *
THEY WATCH HIM GO IN. BARNEY LOOKS AT THE NAMETAG OF THE CAB *
DRIVER. IT READS “RANJIT SINGH.”
BARNEY
Hey, Ranjit. Where you from? Lebanon? *
39.
RANJIT
Bangladesh.
BARNEY
That’s too bad. Lebanese girls,
Ranjit. Lebanese girls.
LILY *
Okay, I already can’t take this *
anymore. I’m gonna go see if that *
bodega has a bathroom, I gotta pee. *
LILY GETS OUT. *
MARSHALL *
Should I come with you? *
LILY *
Do you have to pee? *
MARSHALL *
No. *
LILY *
Then stay. (AS IF TO A DOG) Stay. *
SHE EXITS. *
INT. ROBIN’S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
(TED, ROBIN)
THE APARTMENT IS STYLISH AND NEAT, EXCEPT FOR FIVE DOGS THAT
WANDER ABOUT. ROBIN HANGS THE FRENCH HORN OVER THE FIREPLACE, *
THEN STEPS BACK NEXT TO TED TO ASSESS IT. *
TED
That looks...just terrible. 
40.
ROBIN
Heinous. So, Ted, what brings you to *
Brooklyn at one in the morning with a *
blue French horn? *
TED
Well, you know, our night ended so *
abruptly. And ever since I’ve been *
kicking myself, because I really *
wanted to...get those olives from you. *
ROBIN
(SMILES) Would you like those olives *
with some gin and vermouth?
TED
Some would call that a martini. *
SHE EXITS INTO THE KITCHEN. *
TED (CONT’D) *
This is good, this is good... *
HE WHIPS OUT HIS PHONE AND STARTS TO DIAL. *
ROBIN (O.S.)
One drink, then I’m kicking you out.
HE PUTS THE PHONE AWAY.
ROBIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Although the subway may be closed.
HE WHIPS OUT THE PHONE AGAIN.
ROBIN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
But there’s a car service that runs *
all night.
41.
TED TURNS TO ONE OF ROBIN’S DOGS, A DACHSHUND.
TED
Is she always this confusing?
ROBIN RETURNS WITH THE MARTINIS, TURNS ON THE STEREO, AND *
STARTS SWAYING BACK AND FORTH SEDUCTIVELY.
ROBIN
You wanna dance?
TED
One second.
TED STARTS TO DIAL HIS PHONE. ROBIN TAKES IT, TOSSES IT.
TED (CONT’D)
Eh, it can wait. *
THEY START SLOW-DANCING. *
INT. 2029 LIVING ROOM - EVENING

THE KIDS CRINGE.
DAUGHTER
Oh God, is this leading up to you *
having sex? *
NARRATOR
Just bear with me, okay?
INT. CAB - NIGHT
(BARNEY, MARSHALL) *
IT’S JUST MARSHALL AND BARNEY NOW. A BEAT.
BARNEY
So Marshall. Ya hate olives. Lily
loves ‘em...but you can’t stand ‘em. 
42.
MARSHALL
Yeah, I’ve never cared for olives.
BARNEY
That’s interesting. Two weeks ago, at
that Spanish restaurant, I seem to *
recall a little dish of olives. And I *
also seem to recall...you had some. *
MARSHALL
Did I?
BARNEY
Cut the crap, Marshall! You like
olives.
MARSHALL MAKES SURE LILY’S GONE, THEN TAKES A DEEP BREATH.
MARSHALL
On our second date, Lily and I went to
this Greek restaurant, and I had a
salad. She started taking my olives,
‘cuz she loves olives, and she asked
if I minded, and I said, “No, I hate *
olives.” Then based on that, Ted came *
up with his whole olive theory, so I *
played along. For nine years. *
BARNEY
Marshall, I’m gonna give you an early *
wedding present: don’t get married.
INT. ROBIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
(ROBIN, TED) *
43.
TED AND ROBIN DANCE. IT’S GETTING PRETTY INTIMATE. ROBIN *
NOTICES TED’S GLASS (EMPTY SAVE FOR OLIVES) ON THE TABLE. *
ROBIN
You didn’t eat your olives. Open up. *
ROBIN TAKES AN OLIVE AND FEEDS IT TO TED.
ROBIN (CONT’D)
You know, I think I like your olive *
theory.
TED
I think I like your new French Horn.
ROBIN
I think I like your nose.
TED
I think I’m in love with you.
INT. BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT *
(MARSHALL, LILY AND BARNEY)
TED, HIS TIE UNTIED, BURIES HIS FACE IN HIS HANDS. MARSHALL, *
LILY AND BARNEY ARE STUNNED.
MARSHALL, LILY AND BARNEY
What?!
INT. 2029 LIVING ROOM - EVENING
(KIDS)
THE KIDS ARE STUNNED.
KIDS
What?!
INT. ROBIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
(ROBIN, TED)
ROBIN PULLS AWAY FROM TED, STUNNED.
44.
ROBIN
What?!
A BEAT. SHE TURNS OFF THE STEREO. *
TED
Wow.
ROBIN *
Yeah. *
TED *
I really said that. *
ROBIN *
You really did. *
TED *
Maybe a little too soon for that. *
ROBIN *
Maybe a wee bit. *
INT. CAB - NIGHT
(BARNEY, RANJIT, MARSHALL, LILY)
MARSHALL AND BARNEY CONTINUE THEIR CONVERSATION.
BARNEY
Ranjit, back me up! He needs to lose
this woman!
RANJIT
I think they seem nice.
BARNEY
Look, you said your stomach’s been
hurting, right? Ya know what that is?
45.
MARSHALL
Canine diabetes?
BARNEY
It’s hunger. You’re hungry, Marshall.
Hungry for experience. Hungry for
something new. Hungry...for olives.
But you’re too scared to do anything
about it.
MARSHALL
Yeah. You’re right. I’m scared. I’m *
scared of everything: cancer,
champagne corks, Katie Couric. But
when I think of spending the rest of
my life with Lily - committing,
forever, no other women - that doesn’t
scare me at all. It’s the best and
least-scary thing I can possibly
imagine. I’m getting married.
REVEAL LILY NOW STANDING BY THE OPEN WINDOW, HAVING HEARD
THIS. SHE LEANS IN TO KISS MARSHALL. HE STOPS HER.
MARSHALL (CONT’D)
(DEEP BREATH) Lily...I like olives.
LILY
(BEAT) We’ll make it work.
SHE KISSES HIM PASSIONATELY.
MARSHALL
There’s something we have to do. *
46.
BARNEY
Ranjit, do not let these two slam in *
your cab. *
MARSHALL
I’ll be right back. (TO LILY) Stay!
MARSHALL RUNS OFF.
INT. ROBIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
(ROBIN, TED) *
TED AND ROBIN SIT ON THE COUCH FOR A BEAT, STUNNED.
ROBIN *
You were about to kiss me! *
TED *
I know! *
ROBIN *
And I was gonna kiss you back. *
Probably drag you into the bedroom. *
You were gonna get some! *
TED *
Really? ‘Cuz, okay, cards on the *
table: I’m just here for sex. Cheap *
meaningless sex. I’m never even gonna *
call you afterwards. *
ROBIN *
(SMILES) Now you’re just telling me *
what I want to hear. *
47.
TED
I’m sorry. I’m not always like this.
It’s just, my best friend got engaged *
and I went a little crazy. And then I
meet you, and you’re so amazing...
ROBIN
You’ve only known me one night.
TED
So? And believe me, I’ve abandoned all *
hope, we’re just talking here. But do *
you really think there’s no such thing
as love at first sight?
ROBIN
Not in 2005. And definitely not in New
York. Ted, I like being single. When I *
need stable companionship, I’ve got
five dogs. I don’t need a boyfriend.
TED
God, why do those words make me wanna
be your boyfriend so badly?
ROBIN
(SHRUGS) The universe hates you?
EXT. ROBIN’S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT
(MARSHALL, LILY, COP, BARNEY)
LILY WAITS ON THE STEPS. MARSHALL APPEARS, HOLDING A BOTTLE
OF CHAMPAGNE.
48.
MARSHALL
Champagne! From the rolling hills of
(CHECKING BOTTLE) New Jersey.
LILY
Oh, honey, can we afford that?
MARSHALL
Step aside, little lady, and watch as
I pop this...
HE UNWRAPS THE FOIL. IT’S A TWIST-OFF.
MARSHALL (CONT’D)
Twist-off cap. Hmm. Kinda takes the *
danger out of it. *
LILY
Wait. (COVERS HER EYES) Okay, do it. *
MARSHALL UNSCREWS THE CAP.
MARSHALL *
Pop. It’s open. *
LILY
(UNCOVERS EYES) I love you, sweetie. *
HE POURS TWO GLASSES.
MARSHALL
I love you too.
MARSHALL AND LILY TRY TO IGNORE IT. THEY’RE JUST ABOUT TO
CLINK GLASSES WHEN A COP APPEARS.
COP
Good evening. Wanna take that inside?
49.
LILY
Oh. We don’t live here.
MARSHALL
See, we just got engaged--
COP
Congratulations. You can’t drink on
the sidewalk. Either dispose of the
bottle, or go inside.
ANGLE ON BARNEY IN THE CAB.
BARNEY
Okay, Ranjit, time to go. *
THE CAB PULLS OFF.
LILY
Son of a bitch!
MARSHALL
Look, we just got engaged. We’re *
having this toast. Officer. Although *
you’re still a hero, and we appreciate
everything you’ve done for this city.
COP
(RE: LILY’S EYE) Did he hit you?
LILY
Ha!
COP
Give me the bottle, sir.
LILY
Give him the bottle, Marshall.
50.
MARSHALL
No!
COP
You’re saying no to me?
LILY
I can’t believe he’s saying no to me.
MARSHALL
See? I can be assertive. I’m gonna be *
a great lawyer.
COP
You’re gonna need one, asshole!
THE COP GRABS MARSHALL AND CUFFS HIM ROUGHLY. *
INT. ROBIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT *
TED AND ROBIN STAND AT THE DOOR, SAYING GOOD NIGHT. *
TED *
Well, have a great trip. Oh, and when *
you tell this story to your friends, *
could you avoid the word “psycho.” I’d *
prefer “eccentric.” *
ROBIN *
(LAUGHS) Noted. *
TED *
Hey, that guy on the bridge -- why’d *
he want to jump, anyway? *
ROBIN *
He told a first date he loved her. *
Kidding. (BEAT) He was just lonely. *

EXT. ROBIN’S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
(TED, ROBIN)
TED RINGS THE DOORBELL. THE DOGS BARK AGAIN. ROBIN ANSWERS.
TED
How do I get to the F train?
ROBIN
Two blocks that way, take a right.
TED
Robin, I figured something out *
tonight. I’m sick of being single. I’m *
not cut out for it. It’s like some *
suit that doesn’t quite fit me. But if *
a woman - not you, just some *
hypothetical woman - were to bear with *
me through all this stuff I clearly *
suck at, I think I’d make a damn good *
husband. Because that’s the stuff I’d
be good at. Stuff like being
supportive. And making her laugh. *
52.
TED(CONT'D)
And walking her five hypothetical *
dogs. And being a good father. And *
being a good kisser. *
ROBIN
Everyone thinks they’re a good kisser.
TED
Oh, I’ve got references.
ROBIN
(LAUGHS) I’m sure you do.
TED
Good night, Robin.
TED EXTENDS HIS HAND. ROBIN SHAKES IT.
TED (CONT’D)
And I’m a good handshaker.
ROBIN
That’s a pretty great handshake.
THEY SMILE AT EACH OTHER. THE HANDSHAKE LINGERS A BEAT.
INT. BAR - LATER
(TED, MARSHALL, LILY, BARNEY, RANJIT, NARRATOR) *
TED, TIE UNTIED, SITS AT A TABLE, SADLY TELLING HIS STORY. *
TED *
And that was it. I’ll probably never *
see her again. *
REVEAL THE OTHER THREE, STARING AT TED LIKE HE’S CRAZY. *
TED (CONT’D) *
What?
53.
MARSHALL
That was the signal!
LILY *
Definitely! That long, lingering *
handshake? You should’ve kissed her. *
BARNEY
There’s no such thing as the signal.
(BEAT) But yeah, that was the signal. *
REVEAL RANJIT SITTING AT THEIR TABLE.
RANJIT
(NODS) Signal.
TED
No, look, Ranjit, you guys weren’t
there!
LILY
Sorry we disappeared. Oh, that reminds *
me. (TO BARNEY) You’re a douche. *
BARNEY
I’ll make it up to you.
LILY
How could you possibly--
POP! A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE OPENS. LILY DUCKS REFLEXIVELY. THE
BARTENDER HANDS BARNEY AN EXPENSIVE BOTTLE OF DOM.
BARNEY
So you can have your stupid toast.
LILY SMILES, SURPRISED AND TOUCHED. BARNEY STARTS POURING.
54.
TED
That wasn’t the signal.
BARNEY *
Yeah, Ted, we’re not on you anymore. *
LILY
God, I’m starving. *
TED REACHES INTO HIS POCKET, HANDS HER THE JAR OF OLIVES.
LILY (CONT’D)
Oh, score!
SHE STARTS DEVOURING THE OLIVES. MARSHALL JOINS IN. *
TED
(SHOCKED) You’re eating olives?
BARNEY
Oh, yeah, your olive theory? Load of *
crap. All right, let’s do this. *
HE HANDS EACH OF THEM A GLASS. THEY RAISE THEM.
LILY
To the future.
THEY CLINK AND DRINK. A BEAT.
TED
That was not the signal.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
I asked her about it years later, and
yeah, that was the signal. I could
have kissed her. *
MONTAGE: ROBIN THROWING A DRINK IN TED’S FACE, THE TWO OF
THEM EATING AT THE RESTAURANT, THE TWO OF THEM DANCING. 
55.
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
But that’s the funny thing about
destiny: it happens whether you plan
it or not. I mean, I thought I’d never
see that girl again. But it turns out *
I was just too close to the puzzle to
see the picture that was forming.
THE LAST SHOT OF THE MONTAGE IS ROBIN AND TED SHAKING HANDS.
NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Because that, kids, is the true story
of how I met my good friend Robin *
Scherbatsky. You know, Aunt Robin.
